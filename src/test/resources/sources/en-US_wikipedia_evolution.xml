      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;'''Salem Hypothesis'''&quot; (named after '''Bruce Salem''') is a name for a [[correlation]] that has been observed amongst [[scientist]]s, between subscribing to [[creationism]] and working in an [[engineering]] discipline.

==Origins==
The &quot;Salem Hypothesis&quot; is credited to Bruce Salem, a regular contributor to the [[Usenet]] [[talk.origins]] newsgroup. It is the &quot;[c]onjecture that an education in the engineering disciplines forms a predisposition to &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Scientific Creationism]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; viewpoints.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtis.com/nat/user/elsberry/evobio/evc/jarg106.html The talk.origins/Evolution Echo Jargon File]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic of creationism [[PZ Myers]] elaborated on its origin and meaning by stating:&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/the_salem_hypothesis.php The Salem Hypothesis], [[PZ Myers]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|It was proposed by a fellow named Bruce Salem who noticed that, in arguments with creationists, if the fellow on the other side claimed to have personal scientific authority, it almost always turned out to be because he had an engineering degree. The hypothesis predicted situations astonishingly well — in the bubbling ferment of talk.origins, there were always new creationists popping up, pompously declaiming that they were scientists and they knew that evolution was false, and subsequent discussion would reveal that yes, indeed, they were the proud recipient of an engineering degree.
&lt;p&gt;
... Of course, it doesn't say that engineers are all creationists: it says that creationists with advanced degrees are often engineers, a completely different thing altogether.}}

== Academic support for the hypothesis ==
In a paper presented to the Iowa Academy of Science, John W. Patterson stated that &quot;engineering educators, senior engineers, and registered professional engineers are perhaps the most prominent leaders of the creationist movement.&quot; Patterson offers two possible explanations for this phenomenon:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/creation/thermo_patterson.html An Engineer Looks at the Creationist Movement], John W. Patterson, ''Proceedings of the Iowa Academy of Science'' 89(2):55-58, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
#Lack of interest among engineering societies in policing themselves with regard to &quot;ethical irresponsibility or scientific incompetence&quot;, allowing their membership to &quot;publicly endorse ludicrous forms of pseudoscience without being publicly chastised by their professional societies.&quot;
#Involvement by engineers in &quot;the rather difficult subjects of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics&quot;, allowing them to &quot;develop confusing and yet authoritative-sounding arguments which are ''un''intelligible to laymen.&quot;

In a working paper, Diego Gambetta and Steffen Hertog state that:
{{quotation|Whether American, Canadian or Islamic, and whether due to selection or field
socialisation, a disproportionate share of engineers seems to have a mindset that
inclines them to entertain the quintessential right-wing features of “[[monism]]” – ‘why
argue when there is one best solution’ – and of &quot;[[Wiktionary:simplism|simplism]]” – ‘if only people were
rational, remedies would be simple’.}}
They further note that a Carnegie survey shows that &quot;engineers turn out to be by far the most religious group of all academics&quot;, and note the relevance of the Salem hypothesis to these results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/research/workingpapers/2007-10.pdf Engineers of Jihad], Sociology Working Papers Paper Number 2007-10, Diego Gambetta and Steffen Hertog, Department of Sociology, [[Oxford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The concept of [[evolution]] has been applied, not only to biology, but to numerous other fields as well. In various disciplines, both the study of the history of [[technology]] and the history of [[philosophy]], the concept is invoked to structure the successive changes in a technology, a concept, or the thinking of an individual philosopher over the course of his work. Selective Evolution has also been proposed as a means by which ideas propagate, spread and change (See [[Meme]], [[History of philosophy]], [[History of technology]], [[Philosophy of science]]).

In general use, evolution in this context refers to theories which identify, and then connect, the discrete steps involved in the process of change from original idea, to its stable form, for example, the first [[telephone]] used a different process for converting sound into electricity than the first commercial phone, this step would be part of the telephone's evolution. 

The evolution of an idea or concepts should be further analyzed. Changes occur due to specifiable types of stimulus or input during the analytical process; these changes occur along specifiable dementions.

Types of input may include outside information supplied by another thinker external to one's mind, or the realization of a flaw on one's own due to an inherent contradiction or paradox. Changes can also occur seemingly spontaneously, during the evolution of an idea one can receive &quot;inspiration&quot; from various sources that are often seemingly unspecifiable.

Changes can happen to the overall way an idea is structured. One may realize that a simple rearrangement can shed light that seems to fill an invisible void. Changes can occur to specific elements of the idea, some specific component of a conceptual construct can sometimes be altered to be more specific or more broad, or even completely different without disturbing the overall structure, but changing the understanding that the pattern conveys in a beneficial or detrimental way.

Key thinkers in the use of evolution of ideas include [[Hegel]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Pratt]].

The '''dysteleological argument''' or '''argument from poor design''' is an [[argument against the existence of God]], specifically against the existence of a [[creator God]] (in the sense of a God that directly created all species of life). It is based on the following chain of reasoning:

# An [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator [[God]] would [[creation myth|create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

The [[argument]] is structured as a basic [[Modus tollens]]: if &quot;creation&quot; contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

The complete phrase &quot;''argument from poor design''&quot; has rarely been used in the literature, but arguments of this type have appeared many times, sometimes referring to ''poor design'', in other cases to ''suboptimal design'', ''unintelligent design'', or ''dysteleology''; the last is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist Ernst Haeckel to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism (&lt;ref name=&quot;haeckel&quot;&gt;Haeckel, E. (1892). [http://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ] ''The History of Creation'', Appleton, New York&lt;/ref&gt;, p. 331).  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, and ended by proposing, perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek, to set up &quot;a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''&quot; (&lt;ref name=&quot;haeckel&quot; /&gt;, p. 331).  The term ''Incompetent design'' has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design. The name stems from the acronym I.D. and is used to counter-balance arguments for [[intelligent design]] by a creator that are used by creationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Donald|date=2005-07-22|title=&quot;Intelligent&quot; Design versus Evolution|journal=Science|publisher=[[AAAS]]|volume=309|issue=5734|pages=pp. 556–557|accessdate=2008-06-12|doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c|pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of &quot;poor design&quot; cited include:

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials. [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html]

[[Image:Ectopic.gif|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|An artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[Watchmaker analogy]]'.]]

The human [[reproductive system]] includes the following: 

* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases, the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]’s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal. 
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias including intestinal blockage, [[gangrene]], etc., usually resulted in death.[http://skepticfiles.org/origins/jury-rig.htm]

Other arguments:
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot&lt;ref name=&quot;selim&quot;&gt;[[Jocelyn Selim|Selim, Jocelyn]] (2004). ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''. [https://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/0765bb50d404455385256f0000680854?OpenDocument&amp;Click= Useless Body Parts]&lt;/ref&gt;, that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations.  Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case (&lt;ref name=&quot;haeckel&quot;/&gt;, p. 328).
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Panda anatomy|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.
* The pointless existence of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]] in [[human]]s, also the corresponding potentially fatal condition of [[appendicitis]]. The appendix, which is highly developed in [[herbivores]], is meant to aid in the bacterial digestion of [[cellulose]]. Since people use fire and heat to cook now the appendix has become useless. (It has also been proposed that the appendix is involved in development of the immune system within the first year after birth, but subsequently has no function. However some people have congenital absence of their appendix without any reports of impaired immune system function.)
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches (&lt;ref name=&quot;haeckel&quot; /&gt;, p. 326).
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals, in the case of the [[giraffe]] this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's Disease]]. 
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae.
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]].
* The structure of humans' (as well as all [[mammal]]s') [[eye]]s. The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]. (See [[Evolution of the eye#Other developments|Evolution of the eye]]). Six muscles move the eye when three would suffice. [http://2think.org/eye.shtml]
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]].
* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]). Lack of vitamin C results in [[scurvy]] and eventually death. Defective vitamin synthesis pathways are a hallmark of &quot;higher&quot; animals — of which many are predators — because the prey accumulates vitamins which stem either from the eaten plants or are self-synthesized in the captured individual. Thus, higher animals are mostly unable to return to a purely &quot;vegetarian&quot; lifestyle; while conservation of such pathway genes is of no apparent cost to the animal.
* The enzyme [[rubisco]] is a very slow enzyme, yet remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]] and only overcomes this fact by having massive amounts of it inside plant cells. It is also unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen and often attempt to fix oxygen. This causes the enzyme to stop functioning until it is able to kick out the oxygen from the binding site and bind with carbon dioxide.
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite it being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].

Other critics argue that if these design failures are the deliberate products of an intelligent designer, then the designer must be either inept or [[sadism and masochism|sadistic]]. Or possibly there was a large number of designers, as in the old joke that &quot;a camel is a horse designed by a committee&quot;.

== Overview ==
[[Image:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]
&quot;Poor design&quot; is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In terms of a [[fitness landscape]], natural selection will always push &quot;up the hill&quot;, but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]]&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C. ''The Origin of Species'', 6th ed., ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic Evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.

== Criticism ==
The argument from poor design has received a fair share of objections. The proponents of design question the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between &quot;intelligent design&quot; and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dembski|first=William|title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology|publisher=InterVarsity Press|date=1999|isbn=083082314X|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted that the Panda's &quot;thumb&quot; works excellently for what it does — strip leaves.

Several more generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument - that a Creator God would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' matches the Deity's view, but there is no proof that this is valid.  This is, in effect, the argument of the Book of Job:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Responses to criticism==
Many arguments against the argument from poor design have been addressed by its proponents. In the case of the Panda's thumb, the argument isn't that it works, the argument is that the ''design'' is poor - as a real digit would be functionally more effective than modified wrist bones.

In addition, the [[Plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. &quot;Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |year=2004 |month=June |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discover.com/issues/jun-04/features/useless-body-parts/ |accessdate=2007-02-18 |format={{dead link|date=June 2008}} &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ASelim+intitle%3AUseless+Body+Parts&amp;as_publication=Discover&amp;as_ylo=2004&amp;as_yhi=2004&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the claim that uses have been found for &quot;junk&quot; DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose.
The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose (Hirotsune et al., 2003 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html]) has been shown to be entirely wrong (Grey et al., 2006 [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1]).
They also note that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question. [http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html]

In regards to the last argument, proponents note that nobody has studied the effects of increased efficiency in plants in such a way to make this determination possible. Some plants have more and less efficient photosynthesis reactions, such as the [[C3 carbon fixation|C3]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C4]] and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM]] photosynthesis reactions. No such &quot;damaging chemical reactions&quot; occur in the more effective processes.

The original argument rests on the concept of oxidative stress and [[Reactive Oxygen Species|ROS]] - the [[Light-harvesting complex|LHC]] and other components of the photosynthetic array can only absorb a certain amount of energy from sunlight. Absorbing more results in oxidative damage - a well-documented phenomenon in plants. However, this argument does nothing to invalidate the argument from poor design, as it merely shifts the focus of the question to why those specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus were designed to be unable to cope with commonly-encountered levels of solar energy. Natural selection as an explanation fares much better because it posits that photosynthesis originally evolved in an aquatic environment, then later adapted (but imperfectly) to the higher solar energy found in terrestrial environments.

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to [[God]], such as omnipotence, omniscience, or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of &quot;poor design&quot; (as well as the perceived prodigious &quot;wastefulness&quot; of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a &quot;poor&quot; designer, or a &quot;blind&quot; designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, &quot;If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged....&quot;

A counter-argument that has been made against this application of the argument — and that can be used against the argument from poor design itself — points out that the argument from poor design assumes that efficiency and neatness are the only criteria upon which the quality of biological design must be judged. The counter-argument maintains that, in addition to (or instead of) being thought of as an [[engineer]], God is perhaps better thought of as an [[artist]] (possessing the ultimate [[artistic license]]). Moreover, this application of the argument presupposes the accountability of God to the judgement of humanity, an idea most major religions consider to be an enormous conceit that is diametrically opposed to their doctrines. We can know what God is like to a certain extent, but ultimately we cannot know everything about him because he is of necessity on a higher plane to us. However, doctrinal distaste should not rule out the moral issue that a benign God would not include design flaws that lead to pain or unnecessary death, such as the [[appendix]], [[coccyx]], our crowded teeth or a proclivity for [[cancer]] or the birth of babies through the pelvis.  See [[Problem of Evil]]. But insufficient human knowledge may make things that actually are useful seem useless. For instance, it was once thought that tonsils were useless{{Fact|date=January 2008}}, but in fact they have minor disease-preventing properties. But if we can presume to recognize good design and are at the same time allowed to plead ignorance on apparent bad design, aren't we selecting to use the evidence that supports our claim and ignoring that which contradicts it? Evidence of poor design certainly reduces the effectiveness of the argument from design.

The apparently sub-optimal design of organisms has also been used to argue in favour of a god who uses natural selection as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;Francis S. Collins, ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. ISBN 978-1-4165-4274-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguers from poor design regard all these counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]] (God designed it, or it's flawed), leading to the unfalsifiability of intelligent design — if it's good design, God did it, if it's bad design, it's a result of the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Genesis]] 3:16 has God saying to [[Eve]] &quot;I will increase your trouble in pregnancy&quot;). Arguers against poor design argue in turn: if it's poor design, then God would not have done it, so natural selection must have, but wonderful design shows how wonderful natural selection can be. But that really amounts to saying that because we observe both poor design and good, we are allowed to reject a hypothesis that only explains good design and accept one that explains both.

'''''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''''' is a book by [[Marshall McLuhan]], in which he analyzes the effects of [[mass media]], especially the [[printing press]], on [[Europe]]an [[culture]] and human consciousness. It popularized the term ''[[global village (term)|global village]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.31: &quot;But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the simultaneous &quot;field&quot; in all human affairs so that the human family now exists under conditions of a &quot;global village.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and ''Gutenberg Galaxy'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that Marshall McLuhan himself states quite clearly that &quot;although the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a configuration of events, which lies far ahead of alphabet and of scribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have been no Gutenberg. McLuhan 1962, p.40&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of [[consciousness]] wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, &quot;[[The medium is the message]],&quot; McLuhan argues that [[technology|technologies]] are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of [[movable type]] was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the [[printing press]] led to the creation of [[nationalism]], [[dualism]], domination of [[rationalism]], automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and [[Social alienation|alienation]] of [[individual]]s.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival art]] and the exigencies of the single &quot;point of view&quot;. He writes:

:''the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.''&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==The format of the book—a ''mosaic''==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which &quot;develops a [[mosaic]] or field approach to its problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, first line of the unnamed preface on &quot;page 0&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal &quot;causal operations in history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, p.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of 5 parts:

* '''Prologue''',&lt;ref name=&quot;McLuhan-1962-1&quot;&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Gutenberg Galaxy''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.11-263&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Galaxy Reconfigured''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.265-79. The full title of this &quot;epilogue&quot; is &quot;THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bibliographic Index''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.281-89&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Index of Chapter Glosses'''.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the book, part 2, &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, consists of 107 short &quot;chapters&quot;,
many of which are of one, two, or even three pages in length.
Such a large collection of small chapters does fit the picture of a mosaic.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. &quot;Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;To show by exactly what historical process [&quot;modern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence&quot;] was done is the theme of The Gutenberg Galaxy.&quot; McLuhan 1962, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be &quot;complementary to [[The Singer of Tales]] by Albert B. Lord.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLuhan-1962-1&quot; /&gt; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of [[Milman Parry]] who turned to &quot;the study of the Yugoslave epics&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLuhan-1962-1&quot; /&gt; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing 4 epochs of history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«McLuhan divides history in four epochs: the ''oral tribe culture'', the ''manuscript culture'', the ''Gutenberg galaxy'' and the ''electronic age''. For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the ''hand-writing'' terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.»&lt;ref&gt;Isabel morisse and Uwe lehmann, Marshall McLuhan Project, Philosophy, The Gutenberg Galaxy&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral tribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript culture&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan himself proposes to demonstrate that &quot;manuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and that means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to manuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval.&quot; 1962, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gutenberg galaxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Given the clue of &quot;hand-writing&quot; that terminates the &quot;oral phase&quot; one expects &quot;printing&quot; to terminate the manuscript phase and the &quot;electrifying&quot; to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of &quot;electrifying&quot; is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«
The last section of the book, &quot;The Galaxy Reconfigured,&quot; deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.
»&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.0&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This &quot;clash&quot; of electric and print technologies has resolved itself in the Internet and on the World-Wide-Web of our times.

===Oral tribe culture===
The [[oral tradition]] is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, [[nursery rhyme]]s or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of [[All the world's a stage|the ages of man]] (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies [[James Joyce]]'s [[Finnegans Wake]] as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joyce-1964&quot;&gt;&quot;The fall (bababadalghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonner-ronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthur-nuk!) of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all Christian minstrelsy.&quot; Joyce 1964, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the [[Art of memory]].

====The village====
In commenting on the (former) [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;We have gone from the Soviet Union of McLuhan's day to the [[Russia]]n Federation today.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan puts &quot;the advertising and PR community&quot; on a par with them in so far that both &quot;are concerned about access to the media and about results.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gloss 18&quot;&gt;'''gloss 18''': &quot;The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world.&quot; McLuhan 1962, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; More remarkably he asserts that &quot;Soviet concern with media ''results'' is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gloss 18&quot; /&gt;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as [[Print culture|scribal culture]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
«
Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;
»
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associated with this epoch is the [[Art of memory]] (in Latin Ars Memoria).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce's [[Finnegans Wake|''Finnegans Wake'']] (like Shakespeare's [[King Lear|''King Lear'']]) is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book in order to weave together the various strands of his argument.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Throughout Finnegans Wake Joyce specifies the [[Tower of Babel]] as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] calls the reign of the Idols.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Electronic age===
The Chinese are tribal, people of the ear&lt;ref name=&quot;gloss-26&quot;&gt;'''gloss''' 26: Civilization gives the barbarian or tribal man an eye for an ear and is now at odds with the electronic world. McLuhan 1962, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothetical size of the Gutenberg Galaxy qua Galaxy==
It is possible to estimate a hypothetical size of the Gutenberg Galaxy. In 2004/2005, the [[British Library]] claimed it held more than 97 million items, including 13.3 million monographs [http://www.bl.uk/about/annual/2004to2005/pdf/statistics.pdf]; the [[Library of Congress]], approximately 130 million items, including &quot;more than 29 million books&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;About the Library of Congress Website {2008-08-07}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an estimated average book size of 6 [[megabyte|MB]] for a purely textual book containing 1 million words, the Library of Congress in this case would take up 174,000,000,000,000 [[byte]]s (174 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; bytes = 174,000 [[gigabyte|GB]] = 174 [[terabyte|TB]]) of text. Assuming the same book size of the monographs in the British Library (13.3 million), the result is 79,800,000,000,000 bytes or 79.8 TB. Ignoring duplicate holdings (probably high, in the order of 25&amp;ndash;50%), the combined size of the Gutenberg Galaxy by this method would be around 0.25 [[petabyte|PB]], or around 250 hard disks of 1 TB each.

One contention of these calculations is that the definition of &quot;book&quot; is open to debate.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

'''Historicism''' refers to [[philosophy|philosophical]] theories that include one or both of two claims:

# that there is an organic succession of developments, a notion also known as ''[[historism]]'' (in [[German language|German]] ''historismus''), and/or;
# that local conditions and peculiarities influence the results in a decisive way.

It can be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories, which suppose that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]]).

The [[#Biblical historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

The term has developed different and divergent, though loosely related, meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of the [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], influential in [[Nineteenth Century|19th-century]] [[Europe]], as well as in those of [[Karl Marx]], whom he influenced. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and the work of [[Franz Boas]].

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] attacked historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued were at its root.

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term [[New Historicism]], which has some connections to both anthropology and Hegelianism.

== Variants of historicism ==
=== Hegelian historicism ===
The historicist position by Hegel suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history, so that their essence can be sought only through understanding that.  The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only builds upon but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous [[dialectic]] teaching usually summed up by the slogan &quot;[[thesis]], [[antithesis]], and [[synthesis]].&quot;  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], &quot;Philosophy is the history of philosophy,&quot; describes it bluntly. 

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist view of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel sees the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is rooted in [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten frozen [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must put that person in a society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that shaped it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the &quot;Spirit of the Age,&quot; is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, view, where individuals are defined by their interactions.  

These ideas can be taken in several directions.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, took Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, took Hegel's thoughts on societies shaped by the forces of social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress|progress]], and attempted to chart a course that would manipulate these forces to lead to various improved outcomes.  Karl Marx's doctrine of &quot;historical inevitabilities&quot; and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this side of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] comes full circle to the thought of the Hegelian right, arguing among other things that [[capitalism]] disrupts the rooted nature of traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as reflecting the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the &quot;modern&quot; need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would be an influential question in philosophy going forward, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be taken up by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period focused on the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might focus on a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

=== Anthropological Historicism ===

Within [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. It is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory took the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few &quot;cradles of civilization&quot; which grew outwards in circles, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew up in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development reflected adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a spectrum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead focusing on how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by focusing on the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this view, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named Historicism. Boas would later teach at [[Columbia University]] and this would produce a school of thought based on his ideas.

This view would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

=== New Historicism ===
{{main|New Historicism}}

Since the 1950s, when [[Lacan]] and [[Foucault]] argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, which individuals are inexorably entangled with, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the view that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised, answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought sometimes goes by the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same label, ''new historicism'' is also employed for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of the surrounding society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

=== Modern historicism ===

Within the context of 20th century philosophy, the conflict over whether ahistorical and immanent methodologies were sufficient to understand meaning &amp;mdash; that is to say, &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; positivism &amp;mdash; or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This view is often seen as being rooted in the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians in this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

=== Christian historicism ===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological historicism====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has taken place throughout history and continues to take place today; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.  The historicist method is what led reformers throughout Europe to declare that the Pope was the man of sin sitting on the seven hills of Rome.  Examples of famous Christians and Protestant denominations declaring the pope to be the antichrist include the Waldensians, Albigenses, Lollards, Lutherans, Calvinists, Hussians, and a host of individuals, including the father of the modern English Bible [[William Tyndale]] and even articles of faith such as the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].  See [[#External links]] below.

====Dogmatic and Ecclesiastic Historicism==== 
There is also a particular view in [[Ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical [[Humani Generis]].  &quot;They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html Humani Generis, 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
===Karl Marx===
The social theory of [[Karl Marx]], with respect to modern scholarship, stands in a deeply ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have leveled the charge of historicism against his theory since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself at the center stage of many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been leveled against various theoretical strains of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as &quot;vulgar&quot; Marxism. The development of such historicist Marxisms led famously to Marx's assertion that &quot;I am not a Marxist.&quot;

Marx himself expresses a deep critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his much celebrated [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | format = | work = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20 | accessyear = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Karl Marx, &quot;Theses on Feuerbach, III&quot;}}

=== Karl Popper ===
[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: &quot;an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Poverty 3&quot;&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of &quot;historicism&quot; is an accurate description of Hegel, or more a reflection of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks &quot;historicism&quot; and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]] &amp;mdash; calling them all &quot;enemies of the open society&quot;.  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and [[determinism|deterministic]] pattern to [[history]], abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of [[society]], and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he calls &quot;moral historicism&quot;, the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history.  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (coming might is right).  Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls &quot;Historism&quot;, which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the &quot;New Historicism&quot; is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

=== Leo Strauss ===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term &quot;historicism&quot; and reportedly called it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom.  According to Strauss, historicism &quot;rejects political philosophy&quot; and is rooted in the belief that &quot;all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch.&quot; He also identified [[Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of [[Hegel]], [[Marx]], and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that it grew out of [[Christianity]] and was a threat to civic participation, a belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress]] that results from it, can lead to [[tyranny]], [[totalitarianism]], and democratic extremism. In On Tyranny, in his exchange with [[Alexander Kojeve]], he seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Soviet Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled [[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]],  he argues that both [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share mechanisms that make these traditions more resistant to historicism, and therefore to tyranny. His work relies largely on [[Nietzsche's]] critique of progress and historicism in western intellectual history. The implicit criticism of [[Christianity]] and especially [[secularized Christianity]], has contributed to Strauss' status as a pariah in US academic establishments.

'''Neoevolutionism''' is a [[social theory]] that tries to explain the [[evolution of societies]] by drawing on [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and discarding some dogmas of the previous [[social evolutionism]]. Neoevolutionism is concerned with long-term, directional, evolutionary [[social change]] and with the regular patterns of development that may be seen in unrelated, widely separated [[culture]]s.

Neoevolutionism emerged in the 1930s. It developed extensively in the period after the [[Second World War]] -- and was incorporated into [[anthropology]] as well as [[sociology]] in the 1960s.

Its theories are based on empirical evidence from fields such as [[archeology]], [[paleontology]], and [[historiography]]. Proponents say neoevolutionism is objective and simply descriptive, eliminating any references to a moral or cultural system of [[values]].

While the 19th century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by [[Historical Particularism]] as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neoevolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology. 

The neoevolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of [[social progress]], so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories. Then neoevolutionism discards the [[determinism]] argument and introduces [[probability]], arguing that accidents and free will have much impact on the process of social evolution. It also supports the [[counterfactual history]] - asking 'what if' and considering different possible paths that social evolution may (or might have) taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through. The neoevolutionism stresses the importance of [[empirical]] evidence. While 19th century evolutionism used value judgment and assumptions for interpreting data, the neoevolutionism relied on measurable information for analyzing the process of cultural evolution. 

Neoevolutionism important thinkers include:
* [[Ferdinand Tönnies]]. While not strictly a neoevolutionist himself, Tönnies' work is often viewed as the foundation of neo-evolutionism. He was one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that the [[social progress]] is not perfect, it can even be called a regress as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high costs, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society.
* [[Leslie A. White]] (1900-1975), author of ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'' (1959). Publication of this book rekindled interest in the evolutionism among sociologists and anthropologists. White attempted to create a theory explaining the entire history of humanity. The most important factor in his theory is [[technology]]: ''[[Social system]]s are determined by [[technological system]]s'', wrote White in his book, echoing the earlier theory of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. As a measure of society advancement he proposed the measure [[energy consumption]] of given society (thus his theory is known as the [[energy theory of cultural evolution]]). He differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to [[agricultural revolution]] here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness the [[nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula C=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy. This theory is similar to the later theory of [[Kardashev scale]] of Russian astronom, [[Nikolai Kardashev]].
* [[Julian Steward]], author of Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution (1955, reprinted 1979), created the theory of &quot;multilinear&quot; evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than White's theory of &quot;unilinear evolution.&quot; He questioned the possibility of creation of a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity, however he argued that anthropologists are not limited to descriptions of specific, existing cultures. He believed it is possible to create theories analysing typical, common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, and noted there are secondary factors, like political systems, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time, thus this is the multilinearity of his theory of evolution.
* [[Marshall Sahlins]], author of ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960). He divided the evolution of societies into 'general' and 'specific'. General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organisation and adaptiveness to their environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[diffusion]] of their qualities. This leads cultures to deviate from the general evolution and develop in their specific, unique ways (specific evolution).
* [[Gerhard Lenski]]. In his ''Power and Prestige'' (1966) and ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology'' (1974) he expands on the works of [[Leslie White]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. He views the [[technological progress]] as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures. Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise [[energy]], Lenski focuses on [[information]] - it's amount and uses. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) given society has, the more advanced it is. He distinguished four stages of human development, based on the advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through by experience. In the third, the humans start using [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in the technology of communication translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of goods]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: 1) hunters and gatherers, 2) simple agricultural, 3) advanced agricultural, 4) industrial 5) special (like fishing societies).
* [[Talcott Parsons]], author of ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives'' (1966) and ''The System of Modern Societies'' (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses: 1) division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system, 2) adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions, 3) inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems and 4) generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system. He shows those processes on 3 stages of evolution: 1) primitive, 2) archaic and 3) modern. Archaic societies have the knowledge of [[writing]], while modern have the knowledge of [[law]]. Parsons viewed the [[western world|Western civilisation]] as the pinnacle of modern societies, and out of all western cultures he declared the [[United States]] as the most dynamic developed.

'''Macrodevelopment''' is a [[biology|biological]] hypothesis that proposes over millions of years the [[biosphere]] has nonlinearly unfolded [[taxa]] from generic forms to specific forms, in a manner analogous to the way in which a biological [[embryo]] develops in the womb. The hypothesis was created by [[Robert F. DeHaan]].

Science in succeeding centuries has established the [[age of the Earth]] as between four and five billion years, with an exceedingly long history of change and development.

==Scientific concept==
An understanding of [[Geology|geologic]] history and the concomitant history of life requires a comprehension of time which initially may be more than disconcerting. As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], later remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, &quot;the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Playfair RSE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_5_108/ai_54830705 |title= Hutton's Unconformity |author= [[John Playfair]] |format= [[html]] |work= Transactions of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], vol. V, pt. III, 1805, quoted in [[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]], June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutton's words, &quot;we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end,&quot; were in stark contrast to the prevailing [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis creation story]], which held that the Earth has existed for only a few thousand years.  It was still hazardous in Hutton's time to oppose the [[young Earth creationism]] doctrine which was then dominant. Proponents of scientific theories which contradicted scriptural interpretations could not only lose their academic appointments but were legally answerable to charges of [[heresy]] and/or [[blasphemy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceVsDogmaticTheology&quot;&gt; [[Andrew Dickson White]].  ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'' (e.g. [http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/andrew_white/Chapter5.html chapter 5]). [[New York City|New York]]: D. Appleton &amp; Company, 1896. 1978 reprint edition, [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]]: Peter Smith Publisher Inc. ISBN 0-84463-170-1. &lt;br/&gt; [[Simon Winchester]].  ''The Map That changed the World: [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] and the Birth of Modern Geology'' (e.g. chapter 2). [[New York City|New York]]: [[HarperCollins]], 2001. ISBN 0-06019-361-1. &lt;br/&gt; Jack Repcheck.  ''The Man Who Found Time: [[James Hutton]] and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity'' (e.g. chapters 2 &amp; 5). [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]: Perseus Books, 2003. ISBN 0-73820-692-X. &lt;/ref&gt;  charges which, even as late as the 18th century (1700s) in Great Britain, sometimes resulted in a death sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceVsDogmaticTheology&quot;/&gt;

Hutton's comprehension of deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] and [[Metaphysical naturalism#Deep Time|philosophical]] concept was developed further by [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830-33). [[Natural history|Naturalist]] and [[evolution]]ary theorist [[Charles Darwin#Journey of the Beagle|Charles Darwin]] studied Lyell's book exhaustively during his expedition on the ''[[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|HMS Beagle]]'' in the 1830s.

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept, in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia,'' as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Korthof&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://home.planet.nl/~gkorthof/kortho49.htm |title= A Revolution in Palaeontology: Review of Henry Gee's ''In Search of Deep Time'' |author= Gert Korthof |format= [[html]] |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acampbell.ukfsn.org/bookreviews/r/gee.html |title= Book review: ''In Search of Deep Time'' |author= [[Anthony Campbell]] |format= [[html]] |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''In Search of Deep Time.''

==Use of the term==
One of the first uses of '''deep time''' in a general interest publication may have been by [[John McPhee]] in his 1981 book, ''Basin and Range,'' parts of which originally appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.  One of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time, which was cited by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'' (1987), was to &lt;blockquote&gt;Consider the earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Basin and Range'' was republished with four others and additional material in ''[[Annals of the Former World]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;McpheeAnnals&quot;&gt; [[John McPhee]].  ''Annals of the Former World''.  New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 1998.  ISBN 0-37410-520-0. &lt;br/&gt; [[James Hutton]] &quot;reading in the face of rocks the annals of a former world&quot; quote on p. 77.  &lt;/ref&gt;  a title McPhee borrowed from [[James Hutton]]'s observation about the geologist's preoccupation with the &quot;annals of a former world,&quot; the stories figuratively told by layers of rock laid down over many millions of years.

Several [[animal]] groups have undergone '''aquatic adaptation''', going from being purely terrestrial animals to living at least part of the time in water. The [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s in early speciation tend to develop as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, natural selection causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water.
==[[Anapsid]]s==
''[[Archelon]]'', was a genus giant [[Cretaceous]] [[sea turtle]].

''[[Mesosaurus]]'' (and other mesosaurids) were one of the first [[reptiles]] to secondarily return to the sea.

==[[Cetacea]]ns==
{{further|[[Evolution of cetaceans]]}}
During the [[Paleocene]] Epoch (about 55-65 million years ago), a group of [[wolf]]-like [[artiodactyl]]s related to ''[[Pakicetus]]'' began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. They were the ancestors of modern whales.
==[[Diapsid]]s==
Living at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the [[mosasaur]]s and [[pliosaur]]s resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct within a few million years of the dinosaurs. Modern diapsids which have adapted to marine life include marine [[iguana]]s and marine [[crocodile]]s.
==[[Euryapsid]]s==
These marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans, In the case of [[ichthyosaur]]s adapting as fully as the [[dolphins]] they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs, in other cases more to the extent of the seal, as with [[plesiosaur]]s and [[placodont]]s.
==[[Human]]s==
{{seealso|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}
Proponents of the [[Aquatic Ape Hypothesis]] believe that part of [[human evolution]] includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, [[bipedalism]], increased [[subcutaneous fat]], [[Larynx#Descended larynx|descended larynx]], [[vernix caseosa]], a hooded [[human nose|nose]] and various other physiological and anatomical changes. In addition, there have been numerous inventions of devices by humans to adapt to the aquatic environments.

==[[Pinniped]]s==
The fossil records show that [[phocid]]s existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and [[odobenid]]s about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that.

==[[Polar Bear]]s==
Although still primarily a terrestrial animal, the polar bear shows the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (body fat, nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago.

==[[Sirenia]]ns==
{{further|[[Evolution of sirenians]]}}
The ancestors of the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Paleornithology''' also known as '''Avian Paleontology''' is the scientific study of bird evolution and fossil birds. It is a mix of [[ornithology]] and [[paleontology]]. Paleornithology began with the discovery of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. The reptilian relationship of birds and their ancestors, the [[theropod]] dinosaurs, are important aspects of paleornithological research. Other areas of interest to paleornithologists are the early sea-birds ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' , ''[[Hesperornis]]'', and others. Notable paleornithologists are [[Storrs L.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak (2005).

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. This probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type. Thus, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition an suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]].

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other. 

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

      <comment>/* Feminization */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[selfish gene theory]] postulates that [[natural selection]] will increase the frequency of those genes whose phenotypic effects ensure their successful [[DNA replication|replication]]. Generally, a [[gene]] achieves this goal by building, in cooperation with other genes, an [[organism]] capable of transmitting the gene to descendants.
'''Intragenomic conflict''' arises when genes inside a [[genome]] are not transmitted by the same rules, or when a gene causes its own transmission to the detriment of the rest of the genome. (This last kind of gene is usually called selfish genetic element, or ultraselfish gene or [[parasitic DNA]].)

==Nuclear genes==
This section deals with conflict between nuclear genes.

===Meiotic drive===
All nuclear genes in a given [[diploid]] genome cooperate because each [[allele]] has an equal probability of being present in a [[gamete]]. This fairness is guaranteed by [[meiosis]].
However, there is one type of gene, called a segregation distorter, that &quot;cheats&quot; during meiosis or [[gametogenesis]] and thus is present in more than half of the functional gametes. The most studied examples are sd in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' ([[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]]), [[t haplotype]] in ''[[Mus musculus]]'' ([[mouse]]) and sk in ''[[Neurospora]] sp.'' ([[fungus]]).
Segregation distorters that are present in sexual chromosomes (as the X chromosome in several Drosophila species) are denominated sex-ratio distorters, as they induce a sex-ratio bias in the offspring of the carrier individual.

===Killer and target===

The most simple model of meiotic drive involves two tightly linked loci: a ''Killer'' locus and a ''Target'' locus. The segregation distorter set is composed by the allele ''Killer'' (in the ''Killer'' locus) and the allele ''Resistant'' (in the ''Target'' locus), while its rival set is composed by the alleles ''Non-killer'' and ''Non-resistant''. So, the segregation distorter set produces a toxin to which it is itself resistant, while its rival is not. Thus, it kills those gametes containing the rival set and increases in frequency. The tight linkage between these loci is crucial, so these genes usually lie on low recombination regions of the genome.

===True meiotic drive ===

Other systems do not involve gamete destruction, but rather use the asymmetry of [[meiosis]] in females : the driving allele ends up in the [[ovocyte]] instead of in the [[polar bodies]] with a probability greater than one half. This is termed true meiotic drive, as it does not rely on a post-meiotic mechanism. The best-studied examples include the neocentromeres (knobs) of maize, as well several chromosomal rearrangements in mammals. The general molecular evolution of centromeres is likely to involve such mechanisms.

===Lethal Maternal-effects===
{{main|Maternal effect dominant embryonic arrest}}
The [[Maternal effect dominant embryonic arrest|Medea gene]] causes the death of progeny from a heterozygous mother that do not inherit it. It occurs in the [[flour beetle]] (''Tribolium castaneum'').&lt;ref name=beeman&gt;Beeman R, Friesen K &amp; Denell R (1992) Maternal-effect selfish genes in flour beetles.  ''Science'': 256(5053):89-92.  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/256/5053/89 DOI: 10.1126/science.1566060]&lt;/ref&gt;  Maternal-effect selfish genes have been successfully synthesized in the lab.&lt;ref name=chen&gt;Chen C, Huang H, Ward C, Su J, Schaeffer L, Guo M &amp; Hay B (2007) A Synthetic Maternal-Effect Selfish Genetic Element Drives Population Replacement In Drosophila.  ''Science'': 316(5824):597-600.  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;316/5824/597 DOI: 10.1126/science.1566060]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transposons===
[[Transposons]] are autonomous replicating genes that encode the ability to move to new positions in the genome and therefore accumulate in the genomes. They replicate themselves in spite of being detrimental to the rest of the genome.

===Homing endonuclease genes===
Homing endonuclease genes (HEG) convert their rival [[allele]] into a copy of themselves, and are thus inherited by nearly all meiotic daughter cells of a [[heterozygote]] cell. They achieve this by encoding an endonuclease which breaks the rival allele. This break is repaired by using the sequence of the HEG as template.&lt;ref name=&quot;sinkins&quot;&gt;Sinkins, S. &amp; Gould F. (2006) Gene drive systems for insect disease vectors. Nature Reviews, 7, 427-435.&lt;/ref&gt;

===B-chromosome===
[[B-chromosome]]s are nonessential [[chromosome]]s; not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with any member of the normal (A) chromosome set; morphologically and structurally different from the A's; and they are transmitted at higher-than-expected frequencies, leading to their accumulation in progeny. In some cases, there is strong evidence to support the contention that they are simply ''selfish'' and that they exist as ''parasitic'' chromosomes{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. They are found in all major taxonomic groupings of both [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

==Cytoplasmic genes==
This section deals with conflict between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes. Mitochondria represent one such example of a set of cytoplasmic genes, as do [[plasmid]]s and bacteria which have integrated themselves into another species' cytoplasm.

===Males as dead-ends to cytoplasmic genes===
[[Anisogamy]] generally produces [[zygotes]] that inherit cytoplasmic elements exclusively from the female gamete. Thus, males represent dead-ends to these genes.
Because of this fact, cytoplasmic genes have evolved a number of mechanisms to increase the production of female descendants and/or eliminate offspring not containing them.

===Feminization===
Male organisms are converted into females by cytoplasmic inherited protists ([[Microsporidia]]) or bacteria (''[[Wolbachia]]''), regardless of nuclear sex-determining factors. This occurs in [[amphipod]] and [[isopod]] [[Crustacea]] and [[Lepidoptera]].

===Male-killing===
Male [[embryos]] (in the case of cytoplasmic inherited bacteria) or male [[larvae]] (in the case of [[Microsporidia]]) are killed. In the case of embryo death, this diverts investment from males to females who can transmit these cytoplasmic elements (for instance, in ladybird beetles, infected female hosts eat their dead male brothers, which is positive from the viewpoint of the bacterium). In the case of microsporidia-induced larval death, the agent is transmitted out of the male lineage (through which it cannot be transmitted) into the environment, where it may be taken up again infectiously by other individuals. Male-killing occurs in many [[insects]]. In the case of male embryo death, a variety of bacteria have been implicated, including ''Wolbachia''.

===Male-sterility===
[[Anther]] tissue (male [[gametophyte]]) is killed by [[mitochondria]] in [[monoicous]] [[angiosperms]], increasing energy and material spent in developing female gametophytes.

===Parthenogenesis induction===
In certain [[haplodiploid]] [[Hymenoptera]] and [[mites]], in which males are produced asexually, ''[[Wolbachia]]'' and ''[[Cardinium]]'' can induce duplication of the [[chromosome]]s and thus convert the organisms into females. The cytoplasmic bacterium forces [[haploid]] cells to go through mitosis to produce [[diploid]] cells which therefore will be female. This produces an entirely female population. Interestingly, if antibiotics are administered to populations which have become asexual in this way, they revert back to sexuality instantly, as the cytoplasmic bacteria forcing this behaviour upon them is removed.

===Cytoplasmic incompatibility===
In many [[arthropods]], zygotes produced by sperm of infected males and ova of non-infected females can be killed by ''[[Wolbachia]]'' or ''Cardinium''.

===Plasmids===
[[Plasmid]]s are additional circular chromosomes present in many [[bacteria]]. Most plasmids promote [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] between their host and other bacteria, infecting new cytoplasms while retaining a copy inside the original host.
Chromosomal genes are usually not transmitted. Therefore, they bear the costs of replicating the donated plasmid and the costs of increased exposure to [[virus]]es, but gain little in return (but the genes on plasmids may direct production of proteins that are beneficial to bacteria such as those that confer antibiotic resistance properties).

==Evolution of sex==

Conflict between chromosomes has been proposed as an element in the evolution of sex. &lt;ref name=O'Dea&gt;O'Dea, JD (2006) Did Conflict Between Chromosomes Drive the Evolution of Sex? Calodema, 8: 33-34.  [http://julianodea.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_julianodea_archive.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[selfish gene theory]] postulates that [[natural selection]] will increase the frequency of those genes whose [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] effects ensure their successful [[DNA replication|replication]]. A [[gene]] for [[altruism]] can be favored by selection if the altruism is primarily directed at other individuals who share the same gene ([[kin selection]]).

A '''green-beard effect''' gene (or linked genes) produces three phenotypic effects: 
#a perceptible [[Trait (biology)|trait]] &amp;mdash; the hypothetical green beard; 
#recognition of this trait in others; and 
#preferential treatment to those recognized. 

So, this gene is directly recognizing copies of itself, regardless of average relatedness.

Green-beard altruism could, strictly speaking, increase the presence of green-beard phenotypes in a population even if genes are assisting other genes that are not exact copies of themselves in a molecular sense: all that is required is that they produce the three phenotypic characteristics described above.  Green beard genes are vulnerable to mutant genes arising that produce the perceptible trait without the helping behaviour.

The idea of a green-beard gene was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] in his landmark article of 1964 and named by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his classic book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' of 1976. But only in 1998 was the first green-beard gene actually found in nature, most specifically in the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'').&lt;ref name=&quot;RedImportedFireAnt&quot;&gt;Keller &amp; Ross.

White spoke of [[culture]] as a general human phenomenon, and claimed not to speak of ‘cultures’ in the plural. His theory, published in 1959 in ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'', rekindled the interest in [[social evolutionism]] and is counted prominently among the [[neoevolutionism|neoevolutionists]]. He believed that culture – meaning the sum total of all human cultural activity on the planet – was evolving. White differentiated between three components of culture: technological, sociological and ideological, and argued that it was the technological component which plays a primary role or is the primary determining factor responsible for the cultural evolution. White's materialist approach is evident in the following quote: &quot;man as an animal species, and consequently culture as a whole, is dependent upon the material, mechanical means of adjustment to the natural environment&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/material.htm American Materialism]&lt;/ref&gt; This technological component can be described as material, mechanical, physical and chemical instruments, as well as the way people use these techniques. White’s argument on the importance of technology goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/anthropology/White.html Leslie White (The United States, 1900-1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Technology is an attempt to solve the problems of survival.
# This attempt ultimately means capturing enough energy and diverting it for human needs.
# Societies that capture more energy and use it more efficiently have an advantage over other societies.
# Therefore, these different societies are more advanced in an evolutionary sense.

For White “the primary function of culture” and the one that determines its level of advancement is its ability to “harness and control energy.” White's law states that the measure by which to judge the relative degree of evolvedness of culture was the amount of energy it could capture ([[energy consumption]]). White differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to [[agricultural revolution]] here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula 

:''C'' = ''ET'', 

where E is a measure of energy consumed [[per capita]] per year, T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy and C represents the degree of cultural development. In his own words: “''the basic law of cultural evolution''” was “''culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased''.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/cultural/anthropology/White.html Leslie White (The United States, 1900-1975)]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore &quot;we find that progress and development are effected by the improvement of the mechanical means with which energy is harnessed and put to work as well as by increasing the amounts of energy employed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/material.htm American Materialism].&lt;/ref&gt; Although White stops short of promising that technology is the panacea for all the problems that affect mankind, like [[technological utopians]] do, his theory treats technological factor as the most important factor in the [[evolution of society]] and is similar to the later works of [[Gerhard Lenski]], the theory of [[Kardashev scale]] of Russian astronomer, [[Nikolai Kardashev]] and to some notions of [[technological singularity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Society for the Study of Evolution''' is a professional organization of [[evolutionary biologists]]. It was formed in the [[United States]] in 1946 to promote [[evolution]] and the integration of various fields of science concerned with evolution and to organize the publication of a scientific journal to report on new research on evolution across a variety of fileds.

The Society was established at a meeting in St. Louis on March 30, 1946. Fifty-seven scientists attended the meeting, which was chaired by [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] was elected as the Society's first President, with [[E. B. Babcock]], Emerson, and [[J. T. Patterson]] as his Vice-presidents and [[Ernst Mayr]] as secretary.

Five hundred members attended the Society's first meeting annual conference in Boston which was held from December 28 to 31, 1946. The success of the first meeting and a grant from the [[American Philosophical Society]] led to the production of the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''.

Commonly known as 'evolution meeting,' the annual conference is often held together with the Society of Systematic Biology and the [[American Society of Naturalists]]. The next meeting will be held at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], from June 19 to 24, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first [[organisms]] that existed are believed to have been [[unicellular]]. How organisms then became [[multicellular]] is a huge [[evolutionary]] step and is consequently under great debate. However, unlike some other huge steps in evolution, multicellularity is thought to have evolved many times independently - [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[fungi]] had independent evolution paths, and several other [[clades]] have evolved multicellularity; multicellularity exists in both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s, and first appeared several billion years ago in [[cyanobacteria]]. In eukaryotes, it appeared several times starting from around a billion years ago, in algae, kelp, fungi via several independent paths, and in the animal kingdom.

== Hypotheses on origins of multicellularity ==
Because the first multicellular organisms would have lacked hard body parts, they are not well preserved in fossil records&lt;ref&gt;[[A H Knoll]], 2003. ''Life on a Young Planet''. Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-00978-3 (hardcover), ISBN 0-691-12029-3 (paperback). An excellent book on the early history of life, very accessible to the non-specialist; includes extensive discussions of early signatures, fossilization, and organization of life.&lt;/ref&gt;. Until recently [[phylogenetic]] reconstruction has been through [[anatomical]] (particularly [[embryological]]) similarities. This is very inexact, as current multicellular organisms such as [[animals]] and [[plants]] are 500 million years removed from their single celled ancestors. This allows both [[divergent evolution|divergent]] and [[convergent evolution|convergent]] evolutionary processes a huge amount of time to mimic similarities and differences between groups of modern and ancestral species that don't actually exist. While modern phylogenetics uses more sophisticated techniques such as [[alloenzymes]], [[satellite DNA]] and other molecular markers, they are still rather imprecise over such huge timescales. Nevertheless, it is [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the evolution of multicellularity in most, if not all, extant [[clades]] could have happened in one of three distinct ways:

=== Symbiotic Theory ===
{{unreferenced|date=September 2006}}

This theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from [[symbiosis]] (cooperation) of different species of single celled organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to their genomes being incorporated into one, multicellular, organism. Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species.

This kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between [[clown fish]] and [[Heteractis magnifica|Riterri sea anemone]]s. In these cases it is extremely doubtful if either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's DNA could be incorporated into one single [[genome]] to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g. [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] in animal and plant cells - [[endosymbiosis]]) it has only happened extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during [[mitosis]] of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite [[lichen]], while dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more.

=== Cellularisation (Syncytial) Theory ===
{{unreferenced|date=September 2006}}

This theory states that a single unicellular organism could have developed [[endomembrane|internal membrane]] partitions around each of its [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. Many protists such as the [[ciliates]] or [[slime moulds]] can have several nuclei, lending support to this [[hypothesis]]. However, simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions: the [[macronucleus]] serves the organism's needs while the [[micronucleus]] is used for sexual-like reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.

=== The Colonial Theory ===
The third explanation of multicellularisation is the Colonial Theory which was proposed by [[Haeckel]] in [[1874]]. The theory claims that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the [[#Symbiotic Theory|symbiotic theory]], which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some, presumably land-evolved, multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g., [[slime mould|cellular slime molds]]) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those which evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, L., and E. Szathmary, 2002, &quot;Multicellularity: evolution and the egg,&quot; ''[[Nature]] 420'': 745.&lt;/ref&gt;. The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete [[cytokinesis]], though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve [[cellular differentiation]]&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, D. L., 2005, &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15714559   A twelve-step program for evolving multicellularity and a division of labor,]&quot; ''BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology 27'': 299-310. &lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently numerous times (in 16 different protoctistan phyla). For instance, [[Dictyostelium]] is an amoeba which groups together during times of food shortage, forming a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then become slightly differentiated from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protozoa are [[Volvocaceae|Eudorina]] and [[Volvox]] (the latter of which consists of around 10,000 cells, only about 25-35 of which reproduce - 8 asexually and around 15-25 sexually). It can often be hard to tell, however, what constitutes a colonial [[protist]], and what is a multicellular organism in its own right, as the two concepts are usually indistinguishable. This problem plagues most hypotheses of how multicellularisation could have occurred.

However, most scientists accept that multicellular organisms, from all [[phyla]], evolved by the colonial mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mutationism''' (sometimes, “Mendelism”) refers to the theory emphasizing mutation as a creative principle and source of discontinuity in evolutionary change, particularly associated with the founders of modern genetics.  

==The discovery of genetics challenges Darwin's theory==

As the 20th century dawned, geneticists learned that discontinuous variations could arise by [[mutation]] and be transmitted to offspring via stable non-mixing factors: the rules of transmission of these factors constitute Mendel’s laws.  A more revolutionary discovery, from the perspective of evolutionary theory, was that slight variations in quantitative traits that emerge reliably every generation— like the &quot;fluctuations&quot; on which [[Charles Darwin]] built his theory— were not heritable.  This result was shown in a series of breeding experiments carried out by the Danish biologist [[Wilhelm Johannsen]].  From mixtures of different true-breeding varieties of beans of different sizes, selection on a breeding population could be used to sort out the large from the small varieties, but would not change their heights, even though fluctuations in size continued to appear each generation, following the familiar [[normal distribution]].  

This result was understood widely as a direct threat to the &quot;Natural Selection&quot; theory expressed by Darwin in [[The Origin of Species]].  In this theory, infinitesimal hereditary variation arises automatically in response to the effect of &quot;altered conditions of life&quot; on &quot;the sexual organs&quot;.  Because these continuous “fluctuations” occur automatically whenever conditions change, adaptation happens automatically (and by infinitesimal increments: see [[gradualism]]) as selection preserves fluctuations that fit the new conditions.  That is, Darwin proposed a mechanism of variation that made it possible to take infinitesimal hereditary variation for granted, so that it would always be present when needed, but genetics showed that the kind of variation that arises automatically in response to altered conditions is not genetic variation, but environmental variation.

==Mutationism==

Though later associated with [[Mendelian genetics]], mutationism began in the 1890’s (prior to the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws) with the studies of [[Hugo De Vries]] and [[William Bateson]] on naturally occurring discontinuous variations; their thoughts concerning the role of discontinuity in evolution drew on earlier ideas of [[William Keith Brooks]], [[Francis Galton]], and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. 

The &quot;mutationist&quot; view began by abandoning Darwin's idea of automatic fluctuation, embracing instead the concept that variation emerges by rare events of mutation.  This view was expressed in the writings of key founders of genetics, including [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], [[Reginald Punnett]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen]], [[Hugo de Vries]], [[William Bateson]] and others.  Assuming that heritable variation cannot be taken for granted, the mutationists saw evolution as a two-step process of the chance occurrence of a [[mutation]], followed by its persistence or elimination (selection). The mutationists denied that selection is creative, and they gave mutation a certain measure of control over the course of evolution  &lt;ref name=Sto06&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stoltzfus, A |year=2006 | title= Mutationism and the Dual Causation of Evolutionary Change|journal=Evol Dev |volume=8 | pages=304–317 | doi= 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

A common misconception is that the mutationists denied selection.  Instead, mutationists such as Morgan simply understood its role differently.  In the following passage, Morgan (writing in 1916  &lt;ref name=Mor16&gt;{{cite book | author=Morgan, T. H. | year=1916 | title =A Critique of the Theory of Evolution| publisher= Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;) displays a clear understanding of the concept of the probability of fixation of a new mutation, which might be deleterious, neutral, or advantageous: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;If through a mutation a character appears that is neither advantageous nor 
disadvantageous, but indifferent, the chance that it may become established 
in the race is extremely small, although by good luck such a thing may occur rarely.  
It makes no difference whether the character in question is a dominant or a recessive 
one, the chance of its becoming established is exactly the same.  
If through a mutation a character appears that has an injurious effect, however slight 
this may be, it has practically no chance of becoming established. 
If through a mutation a character appears that has a beneficial influence on the 
individual, the chance that the individual will survive is increased, not only for 
itself, but for all of its descendants that come to inherit this character.  It is 
this increase in the number of individuals possessing a particular character, that 
might have an influence on the course of evolution.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morgan resisted calling this process &quot;Natural Selection&quot; because it differed so much from Darwin's view.

== Demise of Mutationism and Rise of the Modern Synthesis ==

While the mutationist view was very popular in the first 3 decades of the 20th century, it was replaced eventually by the Darwinian view expressed in the [[modern synthesis|Modern Synthesis]].  In 1902 [[G. Udny Yule]] argued that a trait reflecting effects of multiple Mendelian characters could show a [[normal distribution]].  Thus, even though variations that arise in response to altered conditions are environmental and non-heritable (contrary to Darwin's assumptions), some of the continuous variation in natural species could have a genetic basis, and could serve as the Mendelian basis for Darwinian gradualism. Nevertheless, the synthesis of Mendelian genetics and Darwinism later put forth by [[R. A. Fisher]] and others did not develop immediately, for various reasons: it could be doubted that natural selection was sufficiently powerful to act on infinitesimal differences; it could be doubted that natural populations had enough heritable variation to support a Darwinian view; a common (erroneous) belief at the time (following Francis Galton's notion of regression to the mean) held that even heritable fluctuations could not lead to large or qualitative changes; and some advocates of Darwinism, such as [[Karl Pearson]], refused to accept Mendelian genetics.  A key conceptual innovation of the Modern Synthesis, crucial for its acceptance &lt;ref name=Sto06&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, was the &quot;gene pool&quot; concept, which argued that natural populations &quot;maintain&quot; abundant heritable variation through a combination of recombination, mixis, recessivity, heterosis and balancing selection.  

At the time of the Darwin centennial in Cambridge in 1909, Mutationism and [[Lamarckism]] were contrasted with Darwin's “Natural Selection” as competing ideas; 50 years later, at the University of Chicago centennial &lt;ref name=Tax60&gt;{{ cite book | editor=Tax, S., and Callender, C. |year=1960 | title=Evolution After Darwin: The University of Chicago Centennial |publisher=University of Chicago Press, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the publication of [[The Origin of Species]], mutationism (like Lamarckism) was no longer seriously considered.  

Nevertheless, after another 50 years, evolutionary biologists are re-considering the mutationist view.

==Contemporary status of mutationism==
With the arrival of [[molecular biology]], scientists studying &quot;molecular evolution&quot; began to suggest mutational explanations for patterns such as genomic nucleotide composition &lt;ref name=Sue62&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sueoka, N. |year=1962 | title=On the genetic basis of variation and heterogeneity of DNA base composition|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS USA]] |volume=48 | pages=582–592 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/48/4/582 | doi=10.1073/pnas.48.4.582}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and eventually it became a characteristic of the field of molecular evolution to emphasize the role of mutation in evolution  
&lt;ref name=Nei83&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Masatoshi Nei|Nei, M.]] | year = 1983 | title = Evolution of genes and proteins | chapter = Genetic polymorphism and the role of mutation in evolution | editor = In: Koehn, P.K. and [[Masatoshi Nei|Nei, M.]] | pages = 165–190 | publisher = Sinauer Association, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contemporary interest  in mutationism is revealed by articles in mainstream research journals that advocate mutationist ideas, using the label &quot;mutationism&quot; &lt;ref name=Sto06&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;neo-mutationism&quot; &lt;ref name=Nei07&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Masatoshi Nei|Nei, M.]] |year=2007 | title=The new mutation theory of phenotypic evolution |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S a |volume=104 | pages=12235–12242 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0703349104 | pmid=17640887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nei05&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Masatoshi Nei|Nei, M.]] |year=2005 | title=Selectionism and Neutralism in Molecular Evolution |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=22(12) | pages=2318–2342}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This perspective often is indicated, not by the term &quot;mutationism&quot;, but by terms such as &quot;new mutations&quot; or &quot;mutation-driven evolution&quot;.  These writings suggest that, since the molecular revolution in the 1960’s and 1970’s, evidence has been accumulating that evolution depends on mutation in a way that was not envisioned in the Modern Synthesis.  The dependence is sufficiently sensitive that rates of evolution reflect even subtle biases in mutation such as transition:transversion bias or GC:AT bias phenomenon.  

Examples in which mutation-biased evolution is not just plausible but seems to be the received view are in regard to genomic [[GC-content]] and the origin of [[isochore (genetics)|isochore]]&lt;ref name=Gra00&gt;{{cite book |author=Graur, D. and [[Wen-Hsiung Li|Li, W-H.]] |year=2000 |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution (second edition)|publisher=Sinauer Associates| isbn=0-87893-266-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the case of the [[GC-content]], because the bond is stronger and more resilient between the G:C pairs than between A:T pairs, selectionists have speculated that a high [[GC-content]] was an [[adaption]] to harsh conditions, either high [[temperature]] &lt;ref name=Argos79&gt;{{cite journal | author=Argos, P., Rossmann, M.G., Grau, U.M., Zuber, A., Frank, G. and Tratschin, J.D. |year=1979 | title= Thermal stability and protein structure|journal=Biochemistry |volume=18 | pages=5698–5703 | doi= 10.1021/bi00592a028}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[UV radiation]]&lt;ref name=Sin70&gt;{{cite journal | author=Singer, C.E. and Ames, B.N. |year=1970 | title= Sunlight ultraviolet and bacterial DNA base ratios|journal=Science |volume=170 | pages=822–826 | doi= 10.1126/science.170.3960.822 | pmid= 5473414}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Oogamy''' is a form of [[anisogamy]] ([[heterogamy]]) in which the female [[gamete]] (e.g. [[Ovum|egg cell]]) is significantly larger than the male gamete and is non-motile. The male gametes are typically highly [[motile]] [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] competing for the fertilization of the immotile egg.

By contrast to [[isogamy]], the gametes are specialized.  The ovum contains nearly all of the materials that will be needed by the [[zygote]] after fertilization, but it typically cannot move.  The sperm contains almost nothing but the male genetic contribution to the zygote, but it is usually tasked with all of the travel necessary to bring the respective gametes together.  The prevalence of oogamy in higher animals leads to the conclusion that this specialization of the gametes results in their performing their respective tasks better and more efficiently than those tasks could be performed by generalist isogametes, particularly the ability to concentrate high-energy substances in a smaller number of ova.

Oogamy predominantly occurs in [[animal]]s, but can also be found in many [[protist]]s, certain orders of [[algae]] ([[Ochrophyte]]s, [[Charophyta|Charophyceans]]), and some plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and some [[gymnosperm]]s like [[cycad]]s and [[ginkgo]].

In some algae, most [[gymnosperm]]s and all [[angiosperm]]s, a variation of oogamy occurs where the [[sperm]] cells are non-motile as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''metasystem transition''' is the [[emergence]], through [[evolution]], of a higher [[level]] of [[organization]] or [[control]]. 

Prime examples are the [[origin of life]], the transition from unicellular to [[multicellular]] organisms, and the emergence of [[symbolic]] [[thought]]. A [[metasystem]] is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as [[molecules]], [[cell (biology)|cells]] or individiduals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed [[individual]], capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more [[complexity theory|complex]], more [[intelligent]], and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems.

The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician [[Valentin Turchin]] in his 1977 book [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231039832/ &quot;The Phenomenon of Science&quot;], and developed among others by [[Francis Heylighen]] in the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project. The related notion of [[evolutionary transition]] was proposed by the biologists [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Eors Szathmary]], in their 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]'', and developed among others by [[Richard Michod]].

== Evolutionary Quanta ==

The following are the classical quanta of metasystem transition and their standard reifications as emergent properties from the inception of [[animal|animate]] life to [[sapience|sapient]] culture:

# Control of Position: [[motility|Motion]]
# Control of Motion: [[sentience|Irritability]]
# Control of Irritability: [[Reflex]]
# Control of Reflex: [[Association (psychology)|Association]]
# Control of Association: [[Thought]]
# Control of Thought: [[Culture]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This article is related to the study of self-replicating units of culture, not to be confused with [[mimetic]]s.''
{{tooshort}}
'''Memetics''' is an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]] based on the concept of the ''[[meme]]''.  Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of [[Richard Dawkins]], it has since turned into a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to [[gene]]s, memetics is analogous to [[genetics]].

==History of the term==
In his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe a unit of human [[cultural transmission]] analogous to the [[gene]], arguing that replication also happens in [[culture]], albeit in a different sense. In his book, Dawkins contended that the meme is a unit of information residing in the brain and is the mutating replicator in human cultural evolution. It is a pattern that can influence its surroundings – that is, it has causal agency – and can propagate. This created great debate among sociologists, biologists, and scientists of other disciplines, because Dawkins himself did not provide a sufficient explanation of how the replication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and ultimately culture, since the principal topic of the book was genetics. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of ''memetics'' in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', but rather coined the term ''meme'' in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, the term &quot;unit of information&quot; came to be defined in different ways by many scientists.

The modern memetics movement dates from the mid 1980s.  A January 1983 [[Metamagical Themas]] column [http://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=On+viral+sentences+and+self-replicating+structures&amp;sig=kF6BGlEe2DzjrQFDIKmH_Evip2A] by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in ''Scientific American'' was influential as was his 1985 book of the same name. &quot;Memeticist&quot; was coined as analogous to &quot;geneticist&quot; originally in ''The Selfish Gene'' and later &quot;Arel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other carriers of them be known as memetics by analogy with 'genetics.'&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22arel+lucas%22+memetics+themas&amp;source=web&amp;ots=jOEa5sHlep&amp;sig=I077Pw-CrIePgwp4L1dBNriys_E] (This might not be the earliest use of &quot;memetics.&quot;)  Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' has been a factor in drawing in people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus was the publication in 1992 of ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' by Tufts University philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], which incorporated the meme concept into a theory of the mind. In his 1993 essay [[Viruses of the Mind]], Richard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various characteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics were picked up by art as well and thus a popular concept (e.g. Neal Stephenson's [[Snow Crash]]).

However, the foundation of memetics in full modern incarnation originates in the publication in 1996, of two books by authors outside the academic mainstream: ''[[Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme]]'' by former [[Microsoft]] executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker player, [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], and ''[[Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society]]'' by [[Aaron Lynch]], a mathematician and philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at [[Fermilab]]. Lynch claimed to have conceived his theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and apparently was not even aware of Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' until his book was very close to publication.

Around the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie, a new e-journal appeared on the web, hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] [http://www.jom-emit.org/ Journal of Memetics – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission''.]  The journal has since then been taken over by [[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[CLEA]] research institute at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent memetics community. (There had been a short-lived paper memetics publication starting in 1990, the ''Journal of Ideas'' edited by Elan Moritz. [http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/idom/irlist/new/1991/91-viii-43-86/Journal_of_Ideas;_Announcement_&amp;_Call_for_Papers.html])[http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/idom/irlist/new/1991/91-viii-43-86/Journal_of_Ideas;_Announcement_&amp;_Call_for_Papers.html])  In 1999, [[Susan Blackmore]], a psychologist at the [[University of the West of England]], published ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetic-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.

The term is a [[transliteration]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}} of the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{Unicode|μιμητής}} (''{{Unicode|mimētḗs}}''), meaning &quot;imitator, pretender&quot;, and was used in 1904 by the German evolutionary biologist [[Richard Semon]], best known for his development of the [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] theory of [[memory]], in his work ''Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren Beziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen'', translated into English in 1921 as ''The Mneme''. Until [[Daniel Schacter]] published ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory'' in 2000, Semon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s prescient 1956 [[Tarner Lecture]] &quot;[[What_is_Life%3F_(Schrödinger)|Mind and Matter]].&quot;

==Internalists and externalists==
The memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as &quot;a unit of [[cultural transmission]]&quot;.  [[Gibran Burchett]], another memeticist responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term memetic engineering, along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as &quot;a unit of [[cultural]] [[information]] that can be copied, located in the brain&quot;. This thinking is more inline with Dawkins and Blackmore as evident in Dr. Susan Blackmore's [[TED (conference)|TED Talks]] Presentation {Feb 2008}. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable cultural artifacts and behaviors. 

These two schools became known as the &quot;internalists&quot; and the &quot;externalists.&quot; Prominent internalists included both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included [[Derek Gatherer]], a geneticist from Liverpool John Moores University and [[William Benzon]], a writer on cultural evolution and music. The main rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot advance as a science, especially a [[quantitative]] science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly quantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will eventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that culture is about [[belief]]s and not [[cultural artifact|artefact]]s, or that artefacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental entities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics, organised as part of the 15th International Conference on [[Cybernetics]], passed a motion calling for an end to definitional debates.

The most advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of ''The Electric Meme'', by [[Robert Aunger]], an anthropologist from the University of Cambridge. Aunger also organised a conference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give their assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of ''[[Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science]]'', edited by Aunger and with a foreword by Dennett, in 2000.

==Maturity==
In 2005, the ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' ceased publication and published a set of &quot;obituaries&quot; for memetics. This was not intended to suggest that there can be no further work on memetics. A relaunch of this journal is in the works and the journal is again accepting new submissions &lt;ref&gt;[http://jom-emit.cfpm.org/ Journal of Memetics - Aims and Scope&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Susan Blackmore]] has left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science writer and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. [[Derek Gatherer]] moved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally publishes on memetics-related matters. [[Richard Brodie]] is now climbing the world professional poker rankings. [[Aaron Lynch]] disowned the memetics community and the words &quot;meme&quot; and &quot;memetics&quot; (without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description &quot;thought contagionist&quot;.  Lynch lost his previous funding from a private sponsor and after his book royalties declined, he was unable to support himself as a private memetics/thought-contagion consultant.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} He died in 2005.

[[Susan Blackmore]] (2002) re-stated the meme definition as whatever is copied from one person to another person, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes, like genes, are replicators. That is, they are information that is copied with variation and selection. Because only some of the variants survive, memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Memes are copied by [[imitation]], teaching and other methods, and they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called [[co-adapted]] meme complexes, or ''memeplexes''. In her definition, thus, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires [[brain]] capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the [[mutation]] rate in [[memetic evolution]] is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every interaction of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a social system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order emerges to create culture.

==Critique==

Benitez-Bribiesca, a critic to memetics, calls it &quot;a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]&quot; and &quot;a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[Consciousness|conciousness]] and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]&quot; among other things. As factual criticism, he refers to the lack of a ''code script'' for memes, as the DNA is for genes, and to the fact that the meme mutation mechanism (i.e., an idea going from one brain to another) is too unstable (low replication accuracy and high mutation rate), which would render the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;Benitez-Bribiesca, Luis (2001): ''[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf Memetics: A dangerous idea]''. Interciecia 26: 29–31, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique comes from [[semiotics]], (e.g., Deacon&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrence Deacon]], The trouble with memes (and what to do about it). ''The Semiotic Review of Books'' 10(3). &lt;/ref&gt;, Kull&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalevi Kull]] (2000), Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality. ''European Journal for Semiotic Studies'' 12(1), 101–120. &lt;/ref&gt;) stating that the concept of meme is a primitivized concept of [[Sign_(semiotics)|Sign]]. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic nature. In other words, meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation (''sensu lato'') and interpretation are signs.
&lt;!-- This last paragraph could be better explained. I'm fimiliar with the subject but was confused. &quot;Tdiadic nature&quot; &quot;degenerate sign&quot; the article would benefit from clarification of these terms. This may not be the proper place to put this but I don't know if there is a discussion page for this article.--&gt;

==New developments==
Dawkins responds in ''A Devil's Chaplain'' that there are actually two different types of memetic processes. The first is a type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a student of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. However, he also describes a self-correcting meme, highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives [[origami]] patterns in elementary schools – except in rare cases, the meme is either passed on in the exact sequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. This type of meme tends not to evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it does. Some memeticists, however, see this as more of a continuum of meme strength, rather than two types of memes.

Another definition, given by [[Hokky Situngkir]], tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the meme, ''memeplexes'', and the ''[[deme (Biology)|deme]]'', seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural [[complex system]]. It is based on the Darwinian [[genetic algorithm]] with some modifications to account for the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics as the way to see [http://cogprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/archive/00003471/ culture as a complex adaptive system], he describes a way to see memetics as an alternative methodology of cultural [[evolution]]. However, there are as many possible definitions that are credited to the word &quot;meme&quot;. For example, in the sense of [[computer simulation]] the term ''[[memetic algorithm]]'' is used to define a particular computational viewpoint.

Memetics can be simply understood as a method for scientific analysis of cultural evolution. However, proponents of memetics as described in the Journal of Memetics – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' believe that 'memetics' has the potential to be an important and promising analysis of culture using the framework of evolutionary concepts. [[Keith Henson]] who wrote ''Memetics and the Modular-Mind'' (Analog Aug. 1987) [http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.mindcontrol/msg/103e03bce6100cac?hl=en&amp;] makes the case that memetics needs to incorporate [[Evolutionary psychology]] to understand the psychological traits of a meme's host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/cults.html Sex, Drugs, and Cults by H. Keith Henson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of time-varying, meme-amplification host-traits, such as those leading to wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mankindquarterly.org/summer2006_henson.html Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2006/4/17/194059/296/ Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War || kuro5hin.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[Christopher diCarlo]] has developed the idea of 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with biological equilibrium. In &quot;Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic&quot; (in press), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in short--memetic equilibrium. But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utility--it is biochemical and it comes in the form of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for memetic equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to maintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of our ancestors—Survival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value). 

The application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental [[sustainability]], has recently been attempted at [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/general/Memetics.htm thwink.org]. Using meme types and memetic infection in several stock and flow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and perhaps only, explained by memes. One model, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/005/DuelingLoops_Paper.htm The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace], argues that the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of one feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/007/MemeticEvolutionOfSolutions.htm The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult Problems], uses memes, the [[evolutionary algorithm]], and the [[scientific method]] to show how complex solutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models are being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.

[[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies]] has postulated what he calls &quot;memetic selection criteria&quot;. These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of [[applied memetics]] to find out if these selection criteria could stand the test of [[quantitative analysis|quantitative analyses]]. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out these tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.

In ''Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution'' (2004, Cambridge University Press), Austrian linguist Nikolaus Ritt has attempted to operationalise memetic concepts and use them for the explanation of long term sound changes and change conspiracies in early English. It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural change can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book makes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two empirically rich case studies.

Australian academic [[S.J. Whitty]] has argued that [[project management]] is a memeplex with the language and stories of its practitioners at its core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8801&amp;dsID=sjw_ijpm_05.pdf A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management] (International Journal of Project Management, 23 (8) 575-583) &lt;/ref&gt; This radical, some say heretical{{Fact|date=June 2008}} approach requires project managers to consider that most of what they call a project and what it is to manage one is an illusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, cleverly conjured up, fashioned, and conveniently labelled by the human brain. It also requires project managers to consider that the reasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit. Project managers are required to consider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving and designing organizations for its own purpose.

Swedish political scientist [[Mikael Sandberg (Swedish political scientist)|Mikael Sandberg]] argues against [[Lamarckism|&quot;Lamarckian&quot;]] interpretations of institutional and technological evolution and studies creative innovation of information technologies in governmental and private organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;“The Evolution of IT Innovations in Swedish Organizations: A Darwinian Critique of ‘Lamarckian’ Institutional Economics”, '''Journal of Evolutionary Economics''', vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb 2007) &lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the effects of active (&quot;Lamarckian) IT strategy versus user–producer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence from Swedish organizations
shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor
behind IT creativity as the ‘Lamarckian’ IT strategy.

==Terminology==
*'''Memotype''' &amp;ndash; is the actual information-content of a meme.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

*'''Meme-complex''' &amp;ndash; (sometimes abbreviated '''[[memeplex]]''') is a collection or grouping of memes that have evolved into a mutually supportive or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to the symbiotic collection of individual [[gene]]s that make up the genetic codes of biological organisms. An example of a memeplex would be a [[religion]].

*'''Memeoid''' &amp;ndash; is a [[neologism]] for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include [[kamikaze]]s, [[suicide bomber]]s and [[cult]] members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. [[Keith Henson]] in &quot;Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies,&quot; ''L5 News'', 1985 pp. 5-8, [http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16177.html] and referenced in the expanded second edition of [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (p. 330).

*'''Memetic Equilibrium''' &amp;ndash; refers to the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that which humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and ideas. The term was coined by [[Christopher diCarlo]] in &quot;Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic (in press).

*'''Teme''' &amp;ndash; (or technomemes) technological replicators.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Otheruses3|Uniformitarianism}}

'''Uniformitarianism,''' in the [[philosophy of science]], assumes that the same natural processes that operate in the [[universe]] now, have always operated in the universe in the past, and at the same rates; and that the same laws of [[physics]] apply everywhere in the universe.    Its methodology is frequently summarized as &quot;the present is the key to the past,&quot; because it holds that all things continue as they were from the beginning of the world. 

The concept of uniformity in [[Geology|geological]] processes can be traced back to the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', published in 1027.&lt;ref name=Hassani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodfield/&gt; Modern uniformitarianism was formulated by Scottish [[Natural history|naturalists]] in the late 18th century, starting with the work of the [[geologist]], [[James Hutton]], which was refined by [[John Playfair]] and popularised by [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'' in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/uniformitarianism Uniformitarianism: World of Earth Science]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''uniformitarianism'' was coined by [[William Whewell]], who also coined the term [[catastrophism]] for the idea that the Earth was shaped by a series of sudden, short-lived, violent events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/10c.html Concept of Uniformitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of uniformitarianism==
According to [[Reijer Hooykaas]] (1963), uniformitarianism is a family of four related propositions, not a single idea:&lt;ref&gt;Reijer Hooykaas, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3TgYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 ''Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology''], Leiden: [[EJ Brill]], 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uniformity of law – the laws of nature are constant.
* Uniformity of methodology – the appropriate hypotheses for explaining the geological past are those with analogy today.
* Uniformity of kind – past and present causes are all of the same kind, have the same energy, and produce the same effects.
* Uniformity of degree – geological circumstances have not changed over time.

None of these connotations requires another, and they are not all equally inferred by uniformitarians.&lt;ref&gt;David Cahan, 2003, ''From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences'', p 95 ISBN 9780226089287.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen Jay Gould's]] first scientific paper, ''Is uniformitarianism necessary?'' (1965), reduced these four interpretations to two, methodological and substantive uniformitarianism&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 1965. [http://www.ajsonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/263/3/223 Is uniformitarianism necessary?] ''American Journal of Science'' 263: pp. 223–228.&lt;/ref&gt;. He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the second as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. Later, Gould expanded on these related propositions in ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'' (1987), stating that Lyell conflated two different types of propositions: a pair of methodological assumptions with a pair of substantive hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Gould118&gt;{{cite book

Methodological assumptions:

* Uniformity of process:  If a past phenomenon can be understood as the result of a process now acting in time and space, do not invent an extinct or unknown cause as its explanation.&lt;ref name=Gould120 /&gt; 

Substantive hypotheses:
* Uniformity of rate:  Change is typically slow, steady, and gradual.&lt;ref name=Gould120&gt;{{cite book

===Methodological assumptions===
The methodological assumptions are universally acclaimed by scientists, and embraced by all geologists. Gould further states that these philosophical propositions must be assumed before you can proceed as a scientist doing science.  &quot;You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around.&quot; You first assume these propositions and &quot;then you go to the out crop of rock.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gould120 /&gt; 

The axiom of uniformity of law is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate inductive inference into the unobservable past.  As James Hutton wrote: “If the stone, for example, which fell today, were to rise again tomorrow, there would be an end of natural philosophy, our principles would fail, and we would no longer investigate the rules of nature from our observations.”&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Hutton
  | first = J
  | title = Theory of the Earth with Proofs and Illustrations
  | date = 1795
  | pages = 297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, the constancy of natural laws must be assumed in our study of the past, because if we do not, then we cannot meaningfully study the past. Making inferences about the past is wrapped up in the difference between studying the observable present and the unobservable past. In the observable present, induction can be regarded as self-corrective. That is to say, our erroneous beliefs about the observable world can be proven wrong and corrected by other observations. This is Popper's principle of [[falsifiability]]. However, past processes are not observable by their very nature. Therefore, in order to come to conclusions about the past, we must assume the invariance of nature's laws.&lt;ref name=Gould119 /&gt;

===Substantive hypotheses===
The substantive hypotheses were controversial and, in some cases, accepted by few.&lt;ref name=Gould118 /&gt;  These hypotheses are judged true or false on empirical grounds through scientific observation and repeated experimental data. This is in contrast with the philosophical assumptions&lt;ref name=Gould120 /&gt; that come before one can do science and so cannot be tested or falsified by science.

The uniformity of state hypothesis (i.e. steadystateism) implies that throughout the history of our earth there is no progress in any inexorable direction. The planet has almost always looked and behaved as it does now.  Change is continuous, but leads nowhere. The earth is in balance: a dynamic steady state. &lt;ref name=Gould123 /&gt;

These divisions have been opposed by later geologists such as [[Celâl Şengör]].{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

==History of Uniformitarianism==
The concept of uniformitarianism in geology was first proposed in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 980-1037), who provided the first uniformitarian explanations for geological processes in ''[[The Book of Healing]]''. He observed that [[mountain]]s were formed after a long sequence of events that predate human existence.&lt;ref name=Hassani&gt;{{cite web|author=Munim M. Al-Rawi and [[Salim Al-Hassani]]|title=The Contribution of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) to the development of Earth sciences|publisher=FSTC|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/ibnsina.pdf|format=PDF|month=November | year=2002|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodfield&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[June Goodfield]] (1965), ''The Ancestry of Science: The Discovery of Time'', p. 64, [[University of Chicago Press]] ([[cf.]] [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=319 The Contribution of Ibn Sina to the development of Earth sciences])&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the formation of mountains, he explained:

{{quote|&quot;Either they are the effects of upheavals of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of the [[earth]], such as might occur during a violent [[earthquake]], or they are the effect of [[water]], which, cutting itself a new route, has denuded the [[valley]]s, the [[Stratum|strata]] being of different kinds, some soft, some hard... It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.&quot;&lt;ref name=Goodfield/&gt;}}

Later in the 11th century, the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]], [[Shen Kuo]], also recognized the concept of '[[deep time]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silvin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sivin | first = Nathan | authorlink = Nathan Sivin | title = Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections | publisher = Ashgate Publishing [[Variorum]] series | year = 1995 | location = [[Brookfield, Vermont]] | pages = III, 23–24 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Book of Healing'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin in the 12th century]], a few other scientists also reasoned in uniformitarian terms, but the principle was not uniformly accepted until the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=Hassani/&gt; The uniformitarian explanation of the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] in [[geological time]] was supported by the 18th-century father of geology, [[James Hutton]] and popularized by [[Charles Lyell]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the debate between the two theories was intense, as the interpretations of uniformitarianism clashed with the prevailing [[religion|religious beliefs]].

==Uniformitarianism and Catastrophism==
Uniformitarianism is a basic principle of modern [[geology]]. It was originally proposed in contrast to [[catastrophism]], which states that the distant past &quot;consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William J. Whewell, ''Principles of Geology'', Charles Leyell, vol. II, London, 1832: Quart. Rev., v. 47, p. 103-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the [[Channeled Scablands]] due to the catastrophic [[Missoula floods|Missoula]] glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history. &lt;blockquote&gt; “Geologists do not deny uniformitarianism in its true sense, that is to say, of interpreting the past by means of the processes that are seen going on at the present day, so long as we remember that the periodic catastrophe is one of those processes.  Those periodic catastrophes make more showing in the stratigraphical record than we have hitherto assumed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Unlike Lyell, modern geologists do not apply uniformitarianism in the same way.  They question if rates of processes were uniform through time and only those values measured druing the history of geology are to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Uniformitarianism is a generalization of the principle of [[actualism (geology)]], which states that all past geological action was like all present geological action. The principle of actualism is the cornerstone of [[paleoecology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Creationism2}}

An '''allegorical interpretation of Genesis''' is a symbolic, rather than literal, reading of the biblical [[Book of Genesis]]. An allegorical interpretation does not necessarily preclude a literal interpretation;  interpreters such as [[Origen of Alexandria]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] maintained that the Bible is true on multiple levels at the same time.

Genesis is part of the canonical scriptures for both [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], and thus to believers is taken as being of spiritual significance. The opening sequences of the book tells the [[Bible|biblical]] story of origins. Those who read Genesis literally believe that it teaches the creation of humanity and the universe in general in a timeframe of six successive days of 24 hours duration. Those who favor an allegorical interpretation of the story claim that its intent is to describe humankind's relationship to creation and the creator.

Some Jews and Christians have long considered the creation account of Genesis as an allegory instead of as historical description, indeed much earlier than the development of modern science. Two notable examples are [[Augustine of Hippo]] (4th century) who, on theological grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain account of Genesis would require [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html]; and the 1st century Jewish scholar [[Philo of Alexandria]], who wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days or in any determinate amount of time. [http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html]

==Interpretation==
===Church Historians on Allegorical Interpretation of Genesis===

The literalist reading of some contemporary Christians maligns the allegorical or mythical interpretation of Genesis as a belated attempt to reconcile science with the biblical account. They maintain that the story of origins had always been interpreted literally until science (and, specifically, biological evolution) arose and challenged it. This view is not the consensus view, however, as demonstrated below:

According to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]]: &quot;[For] most of the history of the Christianity there's been an awareness that a belief that everything depends on the creative act of God, is quite compatible with a degree of uncertainty or latitude about how precisely that unfolds in creative time.&lt;ref name=&quot;AofC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html|title=Transcript of Archbishop's interview with The Guardian|accessdate=September 9 2007|dateformat=mdy|publisher=Rowan Williams Archbishop of Canterbury|year=2006|author=Rowan Williams|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some religious historians consider that [[Biblical literalism]] came about with the rise of [[Protestantism]]; before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the Bible was not usually interpreted in a completely literal way. Fr. [[Stanley Jaki]], a [[Benedictine]] priest and theologian who is also a distinguished physicist, states in his ''Bible and Science'' (Christendom Press, 1996):

[[Image:Albrecht Dürer 002.jpg|thumb|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1507).]]

:&quot;Insofar as the study of the original languages of the Bible was severed from authoritative ecclesiastical preaching as its matrix, it fueled literalism... Biblical literalism taken for a source of scientific information is making the rounds even nowadays among creationists who would merit [[Julian Huxley]]'s description of 'bibliolaters.' They merely bring discredit to the Bible as they pile grist upon grist on the mills of latter-day Huxleys, such as [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]], [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]], and others. The fallacies of creationism go deeper than fallacious reasonings about scientific data. Where creationism is fundamentally at fault is its resting its case on a theological faultline: the biblicism constructed by the [Protestant] Reformers.&quot; (Jaki, pages 110-111)

However, the Russian Orthodox [[hieromonk]] Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]] has argued that leading Orthodox saints such as [[Basil the Great]], [[Gregory Nazianzus|Gregory the Theologian]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Ephraim the Syrian]] believed that Genesis should be treated as a historical account. (''Genesis, Creation and Early Man'', 
Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, CA, 2000) [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/evolution_frseraphim_kalomiros.aspx], [http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v16/i3/orthodoxy.asp].

===Contradictions===
Contradictions in a text require some interpretation if the text is to be considered internally consistent.  If the Genesis texts are taken literally and as chronological accounts, there are several prima facie examples, including:
*'''Gen 2:17''' God says to Adam, &quot;for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; '''Gen 5:5''' Adam lives several hundreds of years after eating the fruit.
*'''Gen 7:7-10''' Noah entered the ark seven days before the flood began. '''Gen 7:11-13''' Noah entered the ark on the same day that the flood began.
*'''Gen 7:8, 9, 15''' Noah brought two of every clean and unclean animal. '''Gen 7:2''' Noah brought seven of every clean animal (or seven pairs, depending on translation).
*'''Gen 10:5''' Before the Tower of Babel, the land was divided according to tongues. '''Gen 11:1''' Before the Tower of Babel, the whole earth was of one language. 
*'''Gen 21:31''' Beersheba was named by Abraham. '''Gen 26:33''' Beersheba was named by Isaac.

In addition, there are elements of the Genesis story which are in apparent contradiction with other parts of the Bible:
*'''Gen 1:16-19''' The stars were created after the earth. '''Job 38:4-7''' The earth was created after the stars.
*'''Gen 5:3-18''' Enoch was the sixth generation from Adam. '''Jude 14''' Enoch was the seventh generation from Adam.
*'''Acts 7:2-4, Gen 11:26,32''' Abraham was 135 when he left Haran. '''Gen 12:4''' Abraham was 75 when he left Haran.

Some established Christian writers or authorities hold that the notion of contradictions is flawed and based primarily on taking passages out of context, confusing figurative and literal language, exaggeration of minor text variants and other such causes. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia uses the term &quot;apparent contradictions&quot; in its examination of the issue, maintaining that &quot;it follows from what has been said that there can be no contradictions in the Bible, and that there can be no real opposition between Biblical statements...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church, By Charles George Herbermann, Edward Aloysius Pace, Condé Bénoist Pallen, Knights of Columbus Catholic Truth Committee, Thomas Joseph Shahan, John Joseph Wynne, Published by Encyclopedia Press, 1914, p. 274; [http://books.google.com/books?id=kO078Q2kb9wC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=Biblical+contradictions Catholic Encyclopedia on 'apparent biblical contradictions', p 274&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopedia offers the following on what it terms &quot;apparent contradictions.&quot;
:&quot;In other cases the apparent contradictions in the Bible are due to an erroneous exegesis of one or both the passages in question. Such wrong interpretations are easily caused by the change in the meaning of a word; by the assumption of a wrong nexus of ideas (chronological, real, or psychological); by a restriction or an extension of the meaning of a passage beyond its natural limits; by an interchange of figurative with proper, of hypothetical with absolute language;  a concession of Divine authority to mere quotations from profane sources, or by a neglect  of the difference between the Old and the New Testament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern Christian writers repeat this general criticism, arguing that some claims of contradictions in Genesis and elsewhere are so stretched that:
:&quot;It might even be said that if a scholar is expending his efforts to highlight contradictions in the biblical text and is not going beyond that to indicate how they may be resolved, he is not demonstrating his wisdom or honesty so much as he is demonstrating his failure as an interpreter of the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of the Christian Faith: A Comprehensive &amp; Readable Theology, James Montgomery Boice, InterVarsity Press, 1986, ISBN 0877849919, 978087784991, p. 91, pp. 57-118&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Howell, &quot;Are There Contradictions in Genesis 1 and 2?,&quot; (n.d.) retrieved August 14, 2008 from http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401sbs.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Christian Interpretations==
===Finding Allegory in History===
The earliest recorded Christian allegorical interpretation of a passage in Genesis is found in [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Epistle to the Galatians]] in the New Testament. Paul writes:

:&quot;For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman. The child of the slave was born according to the flesh; the child of the free woman was born through the promise. Now this is being allegorized: for these women are two covenants. One, indeed, is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery. This is Hagar, for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children. But the other woman corresponds to the Jerusalem above; she is free, and she is our mother.&quot; [http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Galatians+4%3A22+-+26&amp;section=0&amp;version=nrs&amp;new=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=ga&amp;NavGo=4&amp;NavCurrentChapter=4 Galatians 4:22-26]

The wording of the phrase, &quot;this is being allegorized,&quot; indicates that Paul sees the passage as being true both literally and allegorically.

Other New Testament writers took a similar approach to the [[Jewish Bible]]. The [[Gospel of Matthew]] reinterprets a number of passages. Where the prophet [[Hosea]] has God say of Israel, &quot;Out of Egypt I called my son,&quot; (Hosea 11:1), Matthew interprets the phrase as a reference to Jesus. Likewise, [[Isaiah|Isaiah's]] promise of a child as a sign to King Ahaz (Isaiah 7:14) is understood by Matthew to refer to Jesus. The writer of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] saw symbolism in the rituals of ancient Israel, foreshadowing events in the life and death of Jesus.

Later Christians followed their example. [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]], writing in the middle of the 2nd century, saw the story of Adam, Eve and the serpent pointing to the death of Jesus:

:&quot;Now in this same day that they did eat, in that also did they die. But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after which one is termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon what day out of the seven it was that Adam died, he will find it by examining the dispensation of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole human race from the beginning to the end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the Lord suffered death, in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which Adam died while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which he did eat. For God said, 'In that day on which ye shall eat of it, ye shall die by death.' The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day, underwent His sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, the sixth day of the creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a second creation by means of His passion, which is that [creation] out of death.&quot; (''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-63.htm#P9216_2679777] 5.23.2.)

By the 3rd century, Origen and others of the [[Alexandrian school]] had allegorized nearly every passage in the Jewish Scriptures.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

===Days of Creation===
:''See also: [[Creation according to Genesis]]''

Early Christians  seem to have been divided over whether to interpret the days of creation in Genesis 1 as literal days, or to understand them allegorically.

For example, [[Basil the Great|St. Basil]] rejected an allegorical interpretation in his [[Hexaëmeron]], and affirmed 24-hour creation days:

:&quot;I know the laws of allegory, though less by myself than from the works of others. There are those truly, who do not admit the common sense of the Scriptures, for whom water is not water, but some other nature, who see in a plant, in a fish, what their fancy wishes, who change the nature of reptiles and of wild beasts to suit their allegories, like the interpreters of dreams who explain visions in sleep to make them serve their own ends. For me grass is grass; plant, fish, wild beast, domestic animal, I take all in the literal sense. 'For I am not ashamed of the Gospel' [Romans 1:16].&quot; ( [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/32019.htm Homily IX:1])

:&quot;'And there was evening and there was morning: one day.' And the evening and the morning were one day. Why does Scripture say 'one day the first day'? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says 'one day,' it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day -- we mean of a day and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the time marked by Scripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession never exceeds the space of one day.&quot; ( [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/32012.htm Homily II:8])

[[Justin Martyr]], on the other hand, argued that the days of creation must refer to much longer time spans:

:&quot;For as Adam was told that in the day he ate of the tree he would die, we know that he did not complete a thousand years. We have perceived, moreover, that the expression, 'The day of the Lord is as a thousand years,' is connected with this subject.&quot; ([http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-dialoguetrypho.html Dialogue with Trypho, chapter 81])

[[Origen of Alexandria]], in a passage that was later chosen by [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] for inclusion in the Philocalia, an anthology of some of his most important texts, made the following very modern-sounding remarks:

:&quot;For who that has understanding will sup­pose that the first, and second, and third day, and the evening and the morning, ex­isted without a sun, and moon, and stars? And that the first day was, as it were, also without a sky? And who is so foolish as to suppose that God, after the manner of a husbandman, planted a paradise in Eden, towards the east, and placed in it a tree of life, visible and palpable, so that one tasting of the fruit by the bodily teeth obtained life? And again, that one was a partaker of good and evil by masticating what was taken from the tree? And if God is said to walk in the paradise in the evening, and Adam to hide himself under a tree, I do not suppose that anyone doubts that these things figuratively indi­cate certain mysteries, the history having taken place in appearance, and not literally.&quot; (De Principiis IV, 3, 1 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm])

And in another passage, writing in response to the pagan intellectual [[Celsus]], he said:

:&quot;And with regard to the creation of the light upon the first day, and of the firmament upon the second, and of the gathering together of the waters that are under the heaven into their several reservoirs on the third (the earth thus causing to sprout forth those (fruits) which are under the control of nature alone, and of the (great) lights and stars upon the fourth, and of aquatic animals upon the fifth, and of land animals and man upon the sixth, we have treated to the best of our ability in our notes upon Genesis, as well as in the foregoing pages, when we found fault with those who, taking the words in their apparent signification, said that the time of six days was occupied in the creation of the world.&quot; (''[[Contra Celsus]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04166.htm 6.60])

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], one of the most influential theologians of the Catholic Church, suggested that the Biblical text should not be interpreted literally if it contradicts what we know from science and our God-given reason. From an important passage on his &quot;The Literal Interpretation of Genesis&quot; (early fifth century, AD), St. Augustine wrote:

[[Image:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|right|thumb|St. Augustine of Hippo]]

:&quot;It not infrequently happens that something about the earth, about the sky, about other elements of this world, about the motion and rotation or even the magnitude and distances of the stars, about definite eclipses of the sun and moon, about the passage of years and seasons, about the nature of animals, of fruits, of stones, and of other such things, may be known with the greatest certainty by reasoning or by experience, even by one who is not a Christian. It is too disgraceful and ruinous, though, and greatly to be avoided, that he [the non-Christian] should hear a Christian speaking so idiotically on these matters, and as if in accord with Christian writings, that he might say that he could scarcely keep from laughing when he saw how totally in error they are. In view of this and in keeping it in mind constantly while dealing with the book of Genesis, I have, insofar as I was able, explained in detail and set forth for consideration the meanings of obscure passages, taking care not to affirm rashly some one meaning to the prejudice of another and perhaps better explanation.&quot; (The Literal Interpretation of Genesis 1:19–20, Chapt. 19 [AD 408]) 

:&quot;With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures. In short, it must be said that our authors knew the truth about the nature of the skies, but it was not the intention of the Spirit of God, who spoke through them, to teach men anything that would not be of use to them for their salvation.&quot; (ibid, 2:9)

In the book, Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven days like a plain account of Genesis would require. He argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. Augustine also doesn’t envisage [[original sin]] as originating structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that we should be willing to change our mind about it as new information comes up. [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/PSCF3-88Young.html]

In ''The City of God'', Augustine also defended the idea of a young Earth. Augustine rejected both the immortality of the human race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings:

:&quot;Let us, then, omit the conjectures of men who know not what they say, when they speak of the nature and origin of the human race. For some hold the same opinion regarding men that they hold regarding the world itself, that they have always been... They are deceived, too, by those highly mendacious documents which profess to give the history of many thousand years, though, reckoning by the sacred writings, we find that not 6000 years have yet passed.&quot; (Augustine, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World’s Past], ''The City of God'', Book 12: Chapt. 10 [AD 419]).

St. Augustine also comments on the word &quot;day&quot; in the creation week, admitting the interpretation is difficult:

:&quot;But simultaneously with time the world was made, if in the world's creation change and motion were created, as seems evident from the order of the first six or seven days. For in these days the morning and evening are counted, until, on the sixth day, all things which God then made were finished, and on the seventh the rest of God was mysteriously and sublimely signalized. What kind of days these were it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how much more to say!&quot; (''City of God'', Book 11: Chapt. 6).

==Contemporary Christian considerations==
{{see also|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}
In light of scientific findings regarding the age and origins of the universe and life, many modern Christian theologians, [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Protestant]], have rejected literalistic interpretations of Genesis in favour of allegorical or poetic interpretations such as the [[literary framework view]].

Catholic theologian [[Ludwig Ott]] in his authoritative ''Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma'', under the section &quot;The Divine Work of Creation,&quot; (pages 92–122) covers the &quot;biblical hexahemeron&quot; (the &quot;six days&quot; of creation), the creation of man, Adam/Eve, original sin, the Fall, and the statements of the early Fathers, Saints, Church Councils, and Popes relevant to the matter. Ott makes the following comments on the &quot;science&quot; of Genesis and the Fathers:

:&quot;...as the hagiographers in profane things make use of a popular, that is, a non-scientific form of exposition suitable to the mental perception of their times, a more liberal interpretation, is possible here. The Church gives no positive decisions in regard to purely scientific questions, but limits itself to rejecting errors which endanger faith. Further, in these scientific matters there is no virtue in a consensus of the Fathers since they are not here acting as witnesses of the Faith, but merely as private scientists... Since the findings of reason and the supernatural knowledge of Faith go back to the same source, namely to God, there can never be a real contradiction between the certain discoveries of the profane sciences and the Word of God properly understood.&quot; (Ott, page 92)

:&quot;As the Sacred Writer had not the intention of representing with scientific accuracy the intrinsic constitution of things, and the sequence of the works of creation but of communicating knowledge in a popular way suitable to the idiom and to the pre-scientific development of his time, the account is not to be regarded or measured as if it were couched in language which is strictly scientific... The Biblical account of the duration and order of Creation is merely a literary clothing of the religious truth that the whole world was called into existence by the creative word of God. The Sacred Writer utilized for this purpose the pre-scientific picture of the world existing at the time. The numeral six of the days of Creation is to be understood as an anthropomorphism. God's work of creation represented in schematic form (opus distinctionis -- opus ornatus) by the picture of a human working week, the termination of the work by the picture of the Sabbath rest. The purpose of this literary device is to manifest Divine approval of the working week and the Sabbath rest.&quot; (Ott, page 93, cf. Exod 20:8)

[[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] wrote to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] on the subject of cosmology and how to interpret Genesis:

:&quot;Cosmogony and cosmology have always aroused great interest among peoples and religions. The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer. The Sacred Book likewise wishes to tell men that the world was not created as the seat of the gods, as was taught by other cosmogonies and cosmologies, but was rather created for the service of man and the glory of God. Any other teaching about the origin and make-up of the universe is alien to the intentions of the Bible, which does not wish to teach how heaven was made but how one goes to heaven.&quot; (Pope John Paul II, 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM &quot;Cosmology and Fundamental Physics&quot;])

The &quot;Clergy Letter&quot; Project, drafted in 2004, and signed by thousands of Christian clergy supporting science and faith, states:

:&quot;We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as 'one theory among others' is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God’s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator.&quot; ([http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.uwosh.edu/colleges/cols/religion_science_collaboration.htm An Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science])

Prominent [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] advocates of metaphorical interpretations of Genesis include [[Meredith G. Kline]] and Henri Blocher who advocate the [[literary framework view]]. In ''Beyond the Firmament: Understanding Science and the Theology of Creation'', [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] author Gordon J. Glover argues for an ancient near-eastern cosmology interpretation of Genesis, which he labels the theology of creation:

:&quot;Christians need to understand the first chapter of Genesis for what it is: an 'accurate' rendering of the physical universe by ancient standards that God used as the vehicle to deliver timeless theological truth to His people. We shouldn’t try to make Genesis into something that it’s not by dragging it through 3,500 years of scientific progress. When reading Genesis, Christians today need to transport themselves back to Mt. Sinai and leave our modern minds in the 21st century. If you only remember one thing from this chapter make it this: Genesis is not giving us creation science. It is giving us something much more profound and practical than that. Genesis is giving us a Biblical Theology of Creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last=Glover | first=Gordon J. | year=2007 | title=Beyond the Firmament: Understanding Science and the Theology of Creation | location= Chesapeake, VA| publisher=Watertree | isbn=0978718615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic teachings==

{{main|Judaism and evolution}}

Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as [[Maimonides]] held that it was not required to read Genesis literally. In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of [[science]]. Indeed, [[Maimonides]], one of the great rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]], wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted. Maimonides argued that if science proved a point, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly. 

Rabbi Simeon Bar Yohai in the 2nd century wrote:
:&quot;''If a man looks upon the Torah as merely a book presenting narratives and everyday matters, alas for him! Such a torah, one treating with everyday concerns, and indeed a more excellent one, we too, even we, could compile. More than that, in the possession of the rulers of the world there are books of even greater merit, and these we could emulate if we wished to compile some such torah. But the Torah, in all of its words, holds supernal truths and sublime secrets.''
: ''Thus the tales related in the Torah are simply her outer garments, and woe to the man who regards that outer garb as the Torah itself, for such a man will be deprived of portion in the next world. Thus David said:&quot; Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law&quot; (Psalms 119:18), that is to say, the things that are underneath. See now. The most visible part of a man are the clothes that he has on, and they who lack understanding, when they look at the man, are apt not to see more in him than these clothes. In reality, however, it is the body of the man that constitutes the pride of his clothes, and his soul constitutes the pride of his body.''
: ''Woe to the sinners who look upon the Torah as simply tales pertaining to things of the world, seeing thus only the outer garment. But the righteous whose gaze penetrates to the very Torah, happy are they. Just as wine must be in a jar to keep, so the Torah must also be contained in an outer garment. That garment is made up of the tales and stories; but we, we are bound to penetrate beyond.''&quot; 

[[Nahmanides]], often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the [[Mishnah]] in Tractate Chagigah which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources mention ''Shmitot'' - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of [[yugas]].  According to the tradition of ''Shmitot'', Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.

A literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among Jews today is rare among non-Orthodox groups. Indeed, most Conservative and Reformed denominations hold to the view that the creation story can safely be viewed as allegory.

The position of Orthodox Jews has, for some time, been more or less favorable of a literal approach, as evidenced by the uproar that occurred when modern-day biblical commentators expressed their nonliteral interpretations of the accounts related in Genesis, despite being based heavily on views taken by classical commentators such as [[Rambam]] and [[Gersonides|Ralbag]].  [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], in his work [[The Challenge of Creation]], elaborates on his perspective as it relates to [[Judaism|Judaism's]] encounter with science, cosmology and evolution. Reconciliation of modern science with ortodox literal interpretations is the subject of the works of [[Gerald Schroeder]], a physicist and an expert of theology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[evolutionary biology]], '''carcinisation''' (or '''carcinization''') is a hypothesised process whereby a [[crustacean]] [[evolution|evolves]] into a [[crab]]-like form from a non-crab-like form. The term was introduced by [[L. A. Borradaile]], who described it as &quot;one of the many attempts of [[Nature]] to evolve a crab.&quot;

Carcinisation is believed to have occurred independently in at least five groups of [[Decapoda|decapod]] crustaceans, most notably [[king crab]]s ,which most scientists believe evolved from [[hermit crab]] ancestors (there is still some debate over this point). The other examples are the family Porcellanidae, or [[porcelain crab]]s (these are closely related to [[squat lobster]]s), the ''[[hairy stone crab]]'', the ''[[coconut crab]]'', and the true crab itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no|author = Morrison, C L, A W Harvey, S Lavery, K Tieu, Y Huang &amp; C W Cunningham |year=2001 |title=Mitochondrial gene rearrangements confirm the parallel evolution of the crab-like form |journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. B |volume=269 |number=1489 |pages=345–350 |url=http://www.biology.duke.edu/cunningham/pdfs/Morrison%2520et%2520al.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1886 |format={{Dead link|date=May 2008}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of king crabs (family Lithodidae) evolving from hermit crabs has been particularly well studied and, although some doubt this theory, there is considerable evidence in its favour. For example: most hermit crabs are [[symmetry|asymmetrical]], so that they fit well into spiral [[snail]] [[seashell|shell]]s; the [[abdomens]] of king crabs, even though they do not use snail shells for shelter, are also asymmetrical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Phylogeography''' is the study of the historical processes that may be responsible for the contemporary geographic distributions of individuals.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development== 
While the term phylogeography was first coined in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Avise, J. C., J. Arnold, R. M. Ball, Jr., E. Bermingham, T. Lamb, J. E. Neigel, C. A. Reed, and N. C. Saunders |year=1987 |title=Intraspecific phylogeography: the mitochondrial DNA bridge between population genetics and systematics |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=18 |pages=489–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has existed as a field of study for much longer. [[Historical biogeography]] addresses how historical geological, climatic and ecological conditions influenced the current distribution of species. As part of historical biogeography, researchers had been evaluating the geographical and evolutionary relationships of organisms years before. Two developments during the 1960s and 1970s were particularly important in laying the groundwork for modern phylogeography; the first was the spread of [[cladistic]] thought, and the second was the development of [[plate tectonics|plate tectonics theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=De Queiroz, A. |year=2005 |title=The resurrection of oceanic dispersal in historical biogeography |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=20 |pages=68–73 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting school of thought was [[vicariance biogeography]], which explained the origin of new lineages through geological events like the drifting apart of continents or the formation of rivers. When a continuous population (or species) is divided by a new river or a new mountain range (i.e., a vicariance event), two populations (or species) are created. [[Paleogeography]], [[geology]] and [[paleoecology]] are all important fields that supply information that is integrated into phylogeographic analyses.

Phylogeography takes a [[population genetic]]s and [[phylogenetic]] perspective on [[biogeography]]. In the mid-1970s, population genetic analyses turned to mitochondrial markers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avise98&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Avise, J. C. |year=1998 |title=The history and purview of phylogeography: a personal reflection |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=7 |pages=371–379 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00391.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the process where millions of copies of a [[DNA]] segment can be replicated, was crucial in the development of phylogeography. Thanks to this breakthrough, the information contained in mitochondrial DNA sequences was much more accessible. Advances in both laboratory methods ([[e.g.]] [[capillary]] [[DNA sequencing]] technology) that allowed easier sequencing DNA and computational methods that make better use of the data (e.g. employing [[coalescent theory]]) have helped improve phylogeographic inference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avise98&quot; /&gt;.  

Early phylogeographic work has recently been criticized for its narrative nature and lack of [[statistical]] rigor ([[i.e.]] it did not statistically test alternative hypotheses). The only real method was [[Alan Templeton]]'s Nested Clade Analysis, which made use of an inference key to determine the validity of a given process in explaining the concordance between geographic distance and genetic relatedness. Recent approaches have taken a stronger statistical approach to phylogeography than was done initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Templeton, A. R., E. Routman, and C. A.

'''Example'''

Climate change, such as the glaciation cycles of the past 2.4 million years, has periodically restricted some species into disjunct refugia. These restricted ranges may result in [[population bottlenecks]] that reduce genetic variation. Once a reversal in climate change allows for rapid migration out of refugial areas, these species spread rapidly into newly available habitat. A number of empirical studies find genetic signatures of both animal and plant species that support this scenario of refugia and postglacial expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;T00&quot; /&gt; This has occurred both in the tropics&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Schneider, C.

==Phylogeography and conservation==
Phylogeography can help in the prioritization of areas of high value for conservation. Phylogeographic analyses have also played an important role in defining [[evolutionary significant unit]]s (ESU), a unit of conservation below the species level that is often defined on unique geographic distribution and mitochondrial genetic patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Moritz, C. |year=1994 |title=Defining &quot;evolutionary significant units&quot; for conservation |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=9 |pages=373–375 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(94)90057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study on imperiled cave [[crayfish]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of eastern North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Buhay, J. E. and K. A. Crandall |year=2005 |title=Subterranean phylogeography of freshwater crayfishes shows extensive gene flow and surprisingly large population sizes |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=14 | pages=4259–4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how phylogenetic analyses along with geographic distribution can aid in recognizing conservation priorities. Using phylogeographical approaches, the authors found that hidden within what was thought to be a single, widely distributed species an ancient and previously undetected species was also present. Conservation decisions can now be made to ensure that both lineages received protection. Results like this are not an uncommon outcome from phylogeographic studies.

An analysis of [[salamanders]] of the genus ''[[Eurycea]]'', also in the Appalachians, found that the current taxonomy of the group greatly underestimated species level diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Kozak, K. H., A. B. Russell and A. Larson |year=2006 |title=Gene lineages and eastern North American paleodrainage basins: phylogeography and speciation in salamanders of the ''Eurycea bislineata'' species complex |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |pages=191–207 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02757.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study also found that patterns of phylogeographic diversity were more associated with historical (rather than modern) drainage connections, indicating that major shifts in the drainage patterns of the region played an important role in the generation of diversity of these salamanders. A thorough understanding of phylogeographic structure will thus allow informed choices in prioritizing areas for conservation.

==Comparative phylogeography==
The field of comparative phylogeography seeks to explain the mechanisms responsible for the phylogenetic relationships and distribution of ''different'' species. For example, comparisons across multiple taxa can clarify the histories of biogeographical regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riginos&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Riginos, C. |year=2005 |title=Cryptic vicariance in Gulf of California fishes parallels vicariant patterns found in Baja California mammals and reptiles |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=59 | pages=2678–2690}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, phylogeographic analyses of terrestrial vertebrates on the [[Baja California]] peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Riddle, B. R., D. J. Hafner, L. F. Alexander, and J. R. Jaeger |year=2000 |title=Cryptic vicariance in the historical assembly of a Baja California Peninsular Desert biota |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=97 |pages=14438–14443 |doi=10.1073/pnas.250413397 |pmid=11095731}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marine fish on both the Pacific and gulf sides of the peninsula&lt;ref name=&quot;Riginos&quot; /&gt; display genetic signatures that suggest a vicariance event affected multiple taxa during the [[Pleistocene]] or [[Pliocene]].

Phylogeography also gives an important historical perspective on community composition. History is relevant to regional and local diversity in two ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot; /&gt; One, the size and makeup of the regional species pool results from the balance of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]]. Two, at a local level community composition is influenced by the interaction between local extinction of species’ populations and recolonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot; /&gt; A comparative phylogenetic approach in the [[Australian Wet Tropics]] indicates that regional patterns of species distribution and diversity are largely determined by local extinctions and subsequent recolonizations corresponding to climatic cycles.

==Human phylogeography==
{{main|Recent single-origin hypothesis|Multiregional hypothesis}}
Phylogeography has also proven to be useful in understanding the origin and dispersal patterns of our own species, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Based primarily on observations of skeletal remains of ancient human remains and estimations of their age, anthropologists proposed two competing hypotheses about human origins. The first hypothesis is referred to as the '''[[Recent single-origin hypothesis|Out-of-Africa with replacement]]''' model, which contends that the last expansion out of [[Africa]] around 100,000 years ago resulted in the modern humans displacing all previous ''Homo'' spp. populations in [[Eurasia]] that were the result of an earlier wave of emigration out of Africa. The '''[[Multiregional hypothesis|multiregional]]''' scenario claims that individuals from the recent expansion out of Africa intermingled genetically with those human populations of more ancient African emigrations. 
A phylogeographic study that uncovered a '''[[Mitochondrial Eve]]''' that lived in Africa 150,000 years ago provided early support for the Out-of-Africa model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Cann, R.L., Stoneking, M., and A. C. Wilson |year=1987 |title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=325 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1038/325031a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this study had its shortcomings, it received significant attention both within scientific circles and a wider audience. A more thorough phylogeographic analysis that used ten different genes instead of a single mitochondrial marker indicates that at least two major expansions out of Africa after the initial range extension of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' played an important role shaping the modern human gene pool and that recurrent genetic exchange is pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Templeton, A. R. |year=2002 |title=Out of Africa again and again |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=416 |pages=45–51 |doi=10.1038/416045a}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings strongly demonstrated Africa's central role in the [[evolution]] of modern humans, but also indicated that the multiregional model had some validity.

==Phylogeography of viruses==
Viruses are informative in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change due to their rapid mutation rate and fast generation time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | quotes=no |author=Holmes, E. C. |year=2004 |title=The phylogeography of human viruses |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=13 |pages=745–756 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02051.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogeography is a useful tool in understanding the origins and distributions of different viral strains. A phylogeographic approach has been taken for many diseases that threaten human health, including [[dengue fever]], [[rabies]], [[influenza]] and [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot; /&gt; Similarly, a phylogeographic approach will likely play a key role in understanding the vectors and spread of [[avian influenza]] ([[HPAI H5N1]]), demonstrating the relevance of phylogeography to the general public.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Directed evolution''' is a method used in [[protein engineering]] to harness the power of [[natural selection]] to evolve [[proteins]] or [[RNA]] with desirable properties not found in nature.

A typical directed evolution experiment involves three steps:
# ''Diversification:'' The gene encoding the protein of interest is mutated and/or recombined at random to create a large library of gene variants. Techniques commonly used in this step are error-prone [[PCR]] and [[DNA shuffling]]. 
# ''Selection:'' The library is tested for the presence of [[mutants]] (variants) possessing the desired property using a screen or selection.  Screens enable the researcher to identify and isolate high-performing mutants by hand, while selections automatically eliminate all nonfunctional mutants.  
# ''Amplification:'' The variants identified in the selection or screen are replicated manyfold, enabling researchers to sequence their [[DNA]] in order to understand what mutations have occurred. 

Together, these three steps are termed a &quot;round&quot; of directed evolution.  Most experiments will perform more than one round.  In these experiments, the &quot;winners&quot; of the previous round are diversified in the next round to create a new library.  At the end of the experiment, all evolved protein or RNA mutants are characterized using biochemical methods.  

The likelihood of success in a directed evolution experiment is directly related to the total library size, as evaluating more mutants increases the chances of finding one with the desired properties.    
Performing multiple rounds of evolution is useful not only because a new library of mutants is created in each round, but because each new library uses better mutants as templates.  The experiment is analogous to climbing a hill on a landscape where elevation is a function of the desired property.  The goal is to reach the summit, which represents the best mutant.  Each round of selection samples mutants on all sides of the starting template and selects the mutant with the highest elevation, thereby climbing the hill.  A new round samples mutants on all sides of this new template and picks the highest of these, and so on until the summit is reached.

Directed evolution can be performed in living cells (''in vivo'' evolution) or may not involve cells at all (''in vitro'' evolution).  ''In vivo'' evolution has the advantage of selecting for properties  in a cellular environment, which is useful when the evolved protein or RNA is to be used in living organisms, but ''in vitro'' evolution is often more versatile in the types of selections that can be performed.  Furthermore, ''in vitro'' evolution experiments can generate larger libraries because the  library DNA need not be inserted into cells, the currently limiting step.

The advantage of the directed evolution approach is that the researcher need not understand the mechanism of the desired activity in order to improve it.  An alternative method is [[site-directed mutagenesis]] based on [[X-ray crystallography]] data.  

Most directed evolution projects seek to evolve properties that are useful to humans in an agricultural, medical or industrial context. It is thus possible to use this method to optimize properties that were not selected for in the original organism. This may include [[catalytic specificity]], [[thermostability]] and many others.

==Examples of evolutionary radiation==
Perhaps the most familiar example of an evolutionary radiation is that of [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] immediately after the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s at the end of the [[Cretaceous]], about 65 million years ago. At that time, the placental mammals were mostly small, insect-eating animals similar in size and shape to modern [[shrew]]s. By the [[Eocene]] (58-37 million years ago), they had evolved into such diverse forms as [[bat]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[horse]]s. &lt;ref&gt;This topic is covered in a very accessible manner in Chapter 11 of Richard Fortey's ''Life: An Unauthorised Biography'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other familiar radiations include the [[Cambrian explosion]], the radiation of land plants after their [[Evolutionary history of plants#land|colonisation of land]], the Cretaceous [[Evolutionary history of plants#flowers|radiation of angiosperms]], and the diversification of insects, a radiation that has continued almost unabated since the [[Devonian]], {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref&gt;The radiation only suffered one hiccup, when the [[Permo-Triassic extinction event]] wiped out many species.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of radiation==
Radiations may be discordant, with either diversity or disparity increasing almost independently of the other, or concordant, where both increase at a similar rate.&lt;ref name=Wesley-Hunt2005/&gt;

==Evolutionary radiation in the fossil record==

Much of the work carried out by [[Palaeontology|palaeontologists]] studying evolutionary radiations has been using marine [[invertebrate]] [[fossil]]s simply because these tend to be much more numerous and easy to collect in quantity than large land [[vertebrate]]s such as [[mammal]]s or [[dinosaur]]s. [[Brachiopod]]s, for example, underwent major bursts of evolutionary radiation in the Early [[Cambrian]], Early [[Ordovician]], to a lesser degree throughout the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]], and then again during the [[Carboniferous]]. During these periods, different [[species]] of brachiopods independently assumed a similar morphology, and presumably mode of life, to species that had lived millions of years before. This phenomenon, known as [[homeomorphy]] is explained by [[convergent evolution]]: when subjected to similar selective pressures, organisms will often evolve similar adaptations. &lt;ref&gt;''Living and Fossil Brachiopods'' by M. J. S. Rudwick (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;. Further examples of rapid evolutionary radiation can be observed among [[ammonite]]s, which suffered a series of extinctions from which they repeatedly re-diversified; and [[trilobite]]s which, during the Cambrian, rapidly evolved into a variety of forms occupying many of the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s exploited by [[crustacean]]s today &lt;ref&gt;''Aquagenesis, The Origins and Evolution of Life in the Sea'' by Richard Ellis (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;''Ammonites'' by Neale Monks &amp; Philip Palmer (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;''Trilobite, Eyewitness to Evolution'' by Richard Fortey (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent evolutionary radiations==

A number of groups have undergone evolutionary radiation in relatively recent times. The [[Cichlidae|cichlids]] in particular have been much studied by [[biology|biologists]]. In places such as [[Lake Malawi]] they have evolved into a very wide variety of forms, including species that are filter feeders, snail eaters, brood parasites, algal grazers, and fish-eaters. &lt;ref&gt;The Cichlid Fishes: Nature's Grand Experiment in Evolution by George Barlow (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grass]]es have been another success, evolving in parallel with [[grazing]] [[herbivore]]s such as [[horses]] and [[antelope]] [http://www.palaeos.com/Cenozoic/Cenozoic.htm].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[hypothesis]] of '''effective evolutionary time'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Latitudinal gradients(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause, Oikos, 65, 514-527,1992.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain gradients, in particular latitudinal gradients, in species diversity. It was originally named &quot;time hypothesis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latitudinal gradients(1978a)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. I. A review of the hypotheses explaining the gradients. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 393-403, 1978a.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Latitudinal gradients(1978b)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and their causes. II. Marine parasitological evidence for a time hypothesis. Biologisches Zentralblatt 97, 405-418, 1978b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Low (warm) latitudes contain significantly more species than high (cold) latitudes. This has been shown for many animal and plant groups, although exceptions exist (see [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]]). An example of an exception is [[helminths]] of marine mammals, which have the greatest divers  ity in northern temperate seas, possibly because of small population densities of hosts in tropical seas that prevented the evolution of a rich helminth fauna, or because they originated in temperate seas and had more time for speciations there. It has become more and more apparent that species diversity is best correlated with environmental temperature and more generally environmental energy. These findings are the basis of the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time. Species have accumulated fastest in areas where temperatures are highest. [[Mutation rates]] and [[speed of selection]] due to faster physiological rates are highest, and generation times which also determine speed of selection, are smallest at high temperatures. This leads to a faster accumulation of species, which are absorbed into the abundantly available [[vacant niches]], in the tropics. Vacant niches are available at all latitudes, and differences in the number of such niches can therefore not be the limiting factor for species richness. - The hypothesis also incorporates a time factor: habitats with a long undisturbed evolutionary history will have greater diversity than habitats exposed to disturbances in evolutionary history.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time offers a causal explanation of diversity gradients, although it is recognized that many other factors can also contribute to and modulate them.

==Historical aspects==

Some aspects of the hypothesis are based on earlier studies. [[Bernhard Rensch]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Rensch: Neuere Probleme der Abstammungslehre. Die transspezifische Evolution. Encke, Stuttgart, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, stated that evolutionary rates also depend on temperature: numbers of generation in [[poikilotherm]]s, but sometimes also in homoiotherms ([[homoiothermic]]), are greater at higher temperatures and the effectiveness of selection is therefore greater. Ricklefs refers to this hypothesis as &quot;hypothesis of evolutionary speed&quot; oder &quot;higher speciation rates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Ricklefs: Ecology. Nelson and Sons, London, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Genera of Foraminifera in the Cretaceous and families of Brachiopoda in the Permian have greater evolutionary rates at low than at high latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;F.G. Stehli, E.G. Douglas and N.D. Newell:  Generation and maintenance of gradients in taxonomic diversity. Science 164, 947-949, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; That mutation rates are greater at high temperatures has been known since the classical investigations of [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky|Timofeev-Ressovsky]] et al. (1935),&lt;ref&gt;N.W. [[Timofeeff-Ressovsky]], K.G. Zimmer und M. Delbrück: Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur. Nachrichten aus der Biologie der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften Göttingen I, 189-245, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; although few later studies have been conducted. Also, theses findings were not applied to evolutionary problems.

The hypothesis of effective evolutionary time differs from these earlier approaches as follows. It proposes that species diversity is a direct consequence of temperature-dependent processes and the time ecosystems have existed under more or less equal conditions. Since vacant niches into which new species can be absorbed are available at all latitudes, the consequence is accumulation of more species at low latitudes.&lt;ref name =&quot;Latitudinal gradients(1992)&quot;/&gt; All earlier approaches remained without basis without the assumption of vacant niches, as there is no evidence that niches are generally narrower in the tropics, i.e., an accumulation of species cannot be explained by subdivision of previously utilized niches (see also [[Rapoport's rule]]). The hypothesis, in contrast to most other hypotheses attempting to explain latitudinal or other gradients in diversity, does not rely on the assumption that different latitudes or habitats generally have different &quot;ceilings&quot; for species numbers, which are higher in the tropics than in cold environments.  Such different ceilings are thought to be, for example, determined by heterogeneity or area of the habitat. But  such factors, although not setting ceilings, may well modulate the gradients.

A considerable number of recent studies support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: ''[http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553 Nonequilibrium Ecology]'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. ISBN 0-521-67455-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, diversity of marine [[benthos]], interrupted by some collapses and plateaus, has risen from the Cambrian to the Recent, and  there is no evidence that saturation has been reached. &lt;ref&gt;D.Jablonski: The future of the fossil record, Science 284, 2114-2116, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of diversification per time unit for birds and butterflies increase towards the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cardillo: Latitude and rates of diversification in birds and butterflies. Proceedings of the Royal Society London 266, 1221-1225,1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen et al. found a general correlation between environmental temperature and species richness for North and Central American trees, for amphibians, fish, Prosobranchia and fish parasites. They showed that species richness can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism, and concluded that evolutionary rates are determined by generation times and mutation rates both correlated with metabolic rates which have the same Boltzmann relation with temperature. They further concluded that these findings support the mechanisms for latitudinal gradients proposed by Rohde.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Allen, J.H. Brown, and J.F. Gillooly: Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule. Science, 297, 1545-1548, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillooly et al. (2002) described a general model also based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics which makes predictions about generation times as a function of body size and temperature. &lt;ref&gt;J.F. Gillooly, E.L. Charnov, G.B. West,  M.Van Savage, and J.H. Brown: Effects of size and temperature on developmental time. Nature 417, 70–73, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical findings support the predictions: in all cases that were investigated (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic insects, zooplankton) generation times are negatively correlated with temperature. Brown et al.(2004) further developed these findings to a general metabolic theory of ecology. &lt;ref&gt;J.H. Brown, J.F. Gillooly, A.P. Allen, M. Van Savage, and G.. West,. (2004). Toward a metabolic theory of ecology. Ecology 85, 1771-1789.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect evidence points to increased mutation rates at higher temperatures, &lt;ref&gt;C. Bazin, P. Capy, D. Higuet, and T. Langin, T.: Séquences d’AND mobiles et évolution du génome. Pour Sci., Hors. Sér. Janvier 97, 106-109., 1997 (zitiert in. Harmelin-Vivien 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.L. Harmelin-Vivien: Energetics and fish diversity on coral reefs. In: Sale, P.F. Hrsg. Coral reef fishes. Dynamics and diversity in a complex ecosystem.

Ward and M.Yuan: Energy gradients and the geographical distribution of local ant diversity. [[Oecologia]] 140, 407-413, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, computer simulations using the Chowdhury eosystem model have shown that results correspond most closely to empirical data when the number of vacant niches is kept large.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde and D. Stauffer: &quot;Simulation of geographical trends in Chowdhury ecosystem model&quot;, Advances in Complex Systems 8, 451-464, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Rohde gives detailed discussions of these and other examples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie&quot;. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is the study by Wright et al. (2006) which was specifically designed to test the hypothesis. It showed that molecular substitution rates of tropical woody plants are more than twice as large as those of temperate species, and that more effective [[genetic drift]] in smaller tropical populations cannot be responsible for the differences, leaving only direct temperature effects on mutation rates as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;S.

==Depth gradients==

Species diversity in the deepsea has been largely underestimated until recently (e.g., Briggs 1994: total marine diversity less than 200,000 species).&lt;ref&gt;J. C.Briggs. Species diversity: land and sea compared. Systematic Biology 43, 130-135, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Although our knowledge is still very fragmentary, some recent studies appear to suggest much greater species numbers (e.g., Grassle and Maciolek 1992: 10 million macroinvertebrates in soft bottom sediments of the deepsea).&lt;ref&gt;J F. Grassle and N .J. Maciolek: Deepsea species richness: regional and local diversity estimates from, quantitative bottom samples. American Naturalist 139, 313-341, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies must show whether this can be verified.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rohde: Ecology and biogeography of marine parasites. Advances in marine biology 43,1-86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A rich diversity in the deepsea can be explained by the hypothesis of effective evolutionary time: although temperatures are low, conditions have been more or less equal over large time spans, certainly much larger than in most or all surface waters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All species use restricted niches, and the niches of all species are segregated, often with much overlap, by the use of different habitats, different geographic areas and seasons, and different food resources, to mention only a few of the many niche dimensions. The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology.

==Background==
Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called “classical” ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because “neighbouring” species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of [[natural selection]] introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many [[vacant niches]]. It is based on many empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt?  Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford. &lt;/ref&gt; Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never “universal” in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, ''Toxoplasma'' (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including man, ''Enterobius vermicularis'' infects only man.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

== Niche restriction ==

# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. &lt;/ref&gt;
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This “mating theory of niche restriction” &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches.  Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172. &lt;/ref&gt;is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

== Niche segregation ==

# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., “reinforcement of reproductive barriers”, the so-called Wallace effect)(e.g., Rohde 2005b). &lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative significance of the mechanisms==

Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that [[interspecific competition]] is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London. &lt;/ref&gt; and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don’t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436. &lt;/ref&gt;concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138. &lt;/ref&gt; found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341. &lt;/ref&gt; in his review of competition in ''Drosophila'' and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271. &lt;/ref&gt; has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs.  This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models.  Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation. &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rapoport’s rule''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] hypothesis that states that [[latitude|latitudinal]] ranges of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are generally smaller at low than at high latitudes.

===Background===
Stevens (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1989). ''The latitudinal gradients in geographical range: how so many species co-exist in the tropics''. American Naturalist 133, 240-256.&lt;/ref&gt; named the rule after [[Eduardo H. Rapoport]], who had earlier provided evidence for the phenomenon for subspecies of [[mammal]]s (Rapoport 1975&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1975). ''Areografía. Estrategias Geográficas de las Especies''. Fondo de Cultura Económica, México&lt;/ref&gt;, 1982&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1982). ''Areography. Geographical Strategies of Species''. Trad. B. Drausal, Pergamon Press, Oxford. ISBN 978-0080289144&lt;/ref&gt;). Stevens used the rule to “explain” greater species diversity in the tropics in the sense that [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] and the rule have identical exceptional data and so must have the same underlying cause. Narrower ranges in the tropics would facilitate more species to coexist. He later extended the rule to altitudinal gradients, claiming that altitudinal ranges are greatest at greater altitudes (Stevens 1992 &lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1992). The elevational gradient in altitudinal range: an extension of Rapoport’s latitudinal rule to altitude. American Naturalist 140, 893-911.&lt;/ref&gt;), and to depth gradients in the oceans (Stevens 1996 &lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens1996&quot;&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1996). Extending Rapoport’s rule to Pacific marine fishes. Journal of Biogeography 23:149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;). The rule has been the focus of intense discussion and given much impetus to exploring distributional patterns of plants and animals. Stevens’ original paper has been cited about 330 times in the scientific literature.

===Generality of the rule===
Support for the generality of the rule is at best equivocal&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)&quot;&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01236-6 Gaston, K. J., Blackburn, T. M. and Spicer, J. I. (1998). Rapoport's rule: time for an epitaph? Trends in Ecology and Evolution 13, 70-74.]&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, marine teleost fishes have the greatest latitudinal ranges at low latitudes&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1992&quot;&gt;Rohde, K. (1992). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause. Oikos 65, 514-527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1993&quot;&gt;Rohde, K., Heap, M. and Heap, D. (1993). Rapoport’s rule does not apply to marine teleosts and cannot explain latitudinal gradients in species richness. American Naturalist, 142, 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast, freshwater fishes do show the trend, although only above a latitude of about 40 degrees North&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1993&quot;/&gt;. Some subsequent  papers have found support for the rule, others, probably even more numerous, have found exceptions to it &lt;ref name=&quot;Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1999). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and Rapoport’s rule revisited: a review of recent work, and what can parasites teach us about the causes of the gradients? Ecography, 22, 593-613 &lt;/ref&gt;. For most groups that have been shown to follow the rule, it is restricted to or at least most distinct above latitudes of about 40-50 degrees. Rohde therefore concluded that the rule describes a local phenomenon&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1996&quot;&gt;Rohde, K. (1996). Rapoport’s Rule is a local phenomenon and cannot explainlatitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity Letters, 3, 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;. Computer simulations using the [[Chowdhury Ecosystem Model]] did not find support for the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.thbio.2006.01.002 Stauffer, D., and Rohde, K., 2006. Simulation of Rapoport’s rule for latitudinal species spread. Theory in Bioscioences 125(1): 55-65.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanations of the rule===
Rohde (1996)&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1996&quot;/&gt; explained the fact that the rule is restricted to very high latitudes by effects of glaciations which have wiped out species with narrow ranges, a view also expressed by Brown (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. H. (1995). Macroecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;. Another explanation of Rapoport’s rule is the “climatic variability” or “seasonal variability hypothesis”&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, A. J., and [[Paul H. Harvey|Harvey, P. H.]] (1994) Variation in geographical range size among mammals of the Palearctic. American Naturalist 144:30–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens1996&quot;/&gt;. According to this hypothesis, seasonal variability selects for greater climatic tolerances and therefore wider latitudinal ranges (see also Fernandez and Vrba  2005&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, M. H. and Vrba, E. S. (2005). Rapoport effect and biomic specialization in African mammals: revisiting the climatic variability hypothesis. Journal of Biogeography 32, 903- 918.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Methods used to demonstrate the rule===
The methods used to demonstrate the rule have been subject to some controversy. Most commonly, authors plot means of latitudinal ranges in a particular 5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; latitudinal band against latitude, although modal or median ranges have been used by some&lt;ref&gt;Roy, K., Jablonski, D. and Valentine, J. W. (1994). Eastern Pacific molluscan provinces and latitudinal diversity gradients: no evidence for Rapoport’s rule. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 91, 88.71-8874.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the original paper by Stevens, all species occurring in each band were counted, i.e., a species with a range of 50 degrees occurs in 10 or 11 bands. However, this may lead to an artificial inflation of latitudinal ranges of species occurring at high latitudes, because even a few tropical species with wide ranges will affect the means of ranges at high latitudes, whereas the opposite effect due to high latitude species extending into the tropics is negligible: species diversity is much smaller at high than low latitudes. – As an alternative method the “midpoint method” has been proposed, which avoids this problem. It counts only those species with the midpoint of their ranges in a particular latitudinal band&lt;ref name=&quot;Rohde1993&quot;/&gt;.  An additional complication in assessing Rapoport's rule for data based on field sampling is the possibility of a spurious pattern driven by a sample-size artifact. Equal sampling effort at species-rich and species-poor localities tends to underestimate range size at the richer localities relative to the poorer, when in fact range sizes might not differ among localities&lt;ref name=&quot;ColwellHurtt 1994&quot;&gt;Colwell, R. K., and G. C. Hurtt. (1994). Nonbiological gradients in species richness and a spurious Rapoport effect. American Naturalist 144:570-595.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Biotic and abiotic factors which act against the rule===
Marine benthic invertebrates and some parasites have been shown to have smaller dispersal abilities in cold seas ([[Thorson's rule]]), which would counteract Rapoport’s rule. The tropics have far more uniform temperatures over a far wider latitudinal range (about 45 degrees) than high latitude species. As temperature is one of the most important (if not the most important) factor determining geographical distribution, wider latitudinal ranges in the tropics might therefore be expected.

===Evolutionary age and Rapoport’s rule===
The inconsistent results concerning Rapoport’s rule suggest that certain characteristics of species may be responsible for their different latitudinal ranges.  These characteristics may include, for example, their evolutionary age: species that have evolved recently in the tropics may have small latitudinal ranges because they have not had the time to spread far from their origin, whereas older species have extended their ranges&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1998). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Area matters, but how much? Oikos 82, 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Variome''' is the whole set of [[genetic variation| genetic variations]] found in populations of [[species]] that have gone through a relatively short [[evolution]] change. For example, in the human population about 1 in every 1,200 nucleotide bases will differ. However, as the [[human]] species diverged only 10,000 years ago this variation rate is comparatively small in number. Variome in practice can be the sum of SNPs ([[single nucleotide polymorphisms]]).
'''Variomics''' is the bioinformatic study of variome.
==Variome Projects==
There are a number of international project studying the human Variome that include the [[International HapMap Project]] and the [[Human Variome Project]]. The [[International HapMap Project]] aims to identify and catalog genetic similarities and differences in human beings. The [[Human Variome Project]] (HVP) is an international initiative to collect and curate in a global repository, data on all human genetic variation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Not to be confused with the book [[The Selfish Gene]].''

'''Selfish DNA''' refers to those sequences of [[DNA]] which, in their purest form, have two distinct properties: (1) the DNA sequence spreads by forming additional copies of itself within the [[genome]]; and (2) it makes no specific contribution to the [[reproductive success]] of its host [[organism]].
This idea was sketched briefly by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and was explicitly exposed in two 1980 articles in ''[[Nature]]'' magazine. According to one of these articles:

{{quotation|The theory of natural selection, in its more general formulation, deals with the competition between replicating entities. It shows that, in such a competition, the more efficient replicators increase in number at the expense of their less efficient competitors. After a sufficient time, only the most efficient replicators survive.|L.E. Orgel &amp; F.H.C. Crick|Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite}}

So, the selfish DNA can be considered an efficient replicator that follows another way of increasing in number.

== Examples ==

* [[Transposon]]s copy themselves to different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] inside the genome. These elements constitute a large fraction of [[eukaryotic]] [[genome size]]s ([[C-value]]s): about 45% of the [[human genome]] is composed of transposons and their defunct remnants.

* [[Homing endonuclease gene]]s cleave DNA at its own site on the [[homologous chromosome]], triggering the [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-stranded break repair]] system, which &quot;repairs&quot; the break by copying the HEG onto the homologous chromosome. HEGs have been characterized in [[yeast]], and can only survive by passing between multiple isolated populations or species.

* Supernumerary [[B chromosome]]s are nonessential chromosomes that are transmitted in higher-than-expected frequencies, which leads to their accumulation in progenies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''selective sweep''' is the reduction or elimination of [[genetic variation|variation]] among the [[nucleotide]]s in neighbouring [[DNA]] of a [[mutation]] as the result of recent and strong positive [[natural selection]]. 

A selective sweep can occur when a new mutation occurs that increases the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the carrier relative to other members of the [[population]]. Natural selection will favour individuals that have a higher fitness and with time the newly mutated variant (allele) will increase in frequency relative to other alleles. As its prevalence increases, neutral and nearly neutral genetic variation linked to the new mutation will also become more prevalent. This phenomenon is called ''[[genetic hitchhiking]]''. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the genome where the positively selected [[haplotype]] (the mutated allele and its neighbours) is essentially the only one that exists in the population, resulting in a large reduction of the total genetic variation in that [[chromosome]] region.


== Detecting selective sweeps ==
Whether or not a selective sweep has occurred can be investigated in various ways. One method is to measure [[linkage disequilibrium]], i.e., whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Under neutral evolution, [[genetic recombination]] will result in the reshuffling of the different alleles within a haplotype, and no single haplotype will dominate the population. However, during a selective sweep, selection for a positively selected gene variant will also result in selection of neighbouring alleles and less opportunity for recombination. Therefore, the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate that there has been a recent selective sweep, and can be used to identify sites recently under selection.

A study of genetic variation among 269 humans found evidence for selective sweeps on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 22 &lt;ref name=&quot;IHMC2005&quot;&gt;&quot;A haplotype map of the human genome&quot; (2005) by the International HapMap Consortium in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' Volume 437, pages 1299-1320. {{Entrez Pubmed|16255080}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In maize, a recent comparison of yellow and white corn genotypes surrounding ''Y1'' - the phytoene synthetase gene responsible for the yellow endosperm color, shows strong evidence for a selective sweep in yellow germplasm reducing diversity at this locus and linkage disequilibrium in surrounding regions.  White maize lines had increased diversity and no evidence of linkage disequilibrium associated with a selective sweep. &lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS&quot;&gt;Kelly Palaisa, Michele Morgante, Scott Tingey, and Antoni Rafalski.2004. Long-range patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium surrounding the maize Y1 gene are indicative of an asymmetric selective sweep. PNAS. 101:9885-9890. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The anatomical term '''heterodont''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], meaning 'different teeth') refers to [[animals]] which possess more than a single tooth [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. For example, members of the [[Synapsida]] (which includes [[Mammalia|mammals]]) generally possess [[incisor]]s, [[Canine_(tooth)|canines ('eyeteeth')]], [[premolar]]s, and [[molars]]. The presence of heterodont [[dentition]] is evidence of some degree of feeding/hunting specialization in a [[species]]. By contrast, homodont ('same teeth') dentition is the [[plesiomorphic]] (primitive) state for [[vertebrates]], and is common in [[elasmobranch]]s, bony [[fish]], [[amphibians]], and most [[reptiles]]. Within the [[Sauropsida]], there are occasionally cases of heterodonty, in some forms of [[pterosaurs]] like ''Raeticodactylus filisurensis'', [[lizards]], and [[dinosaur]]s, for example.

The term '''heterodont''' can also refer to members of the Subclass [[Heterodonta]] of the Class [[Bivalvia]].  The name refers to the differentiated hinge teeth which hold together the valves of the shell.

      <comment>/* Early theories */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is an increase in the rate of technological (and sometimes social and cultural) progress throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future. While many have suggested accelerating change, its popularity in modern times is closely associated with the ideas and writings of [[Raymond Kurzweil]], especially in relation to his theories about [[technological singularity]].

==Early theories==
In 1958, [[Stanisław Marcin Ulam|Stanisław Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.}}

In his book &quot;Mindsteps to the Cosmos&quot; (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these &quot;new world views&quot;: the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, computer, radio, TV... &quot;Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos.&quot; He noted: &quot;The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration.&quot; Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two more successively closer mindsteps, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{cquote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of [[memes]] and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}
[[Image:PPTMASSuseInventionsLogPRINT.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mass use of inventions: Years until use by a quarter of US population]]
Since the late 1970s, others like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached theories of [[post-industrial society|postindustrial societies]]. They argue the [[industrial society|industrial era]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are supplanting [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|good]]s. Some more extreme visions of the postindustrial society, especially in [[fiction]], envision the elimination of [[economic scarcity]].

Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with social and cultural evolution. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]], declare technological progress to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. 

Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution ([[savagery]], [[barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, like [[fire]], the [[bow (weapon)|bow]], and [[pottery]] in the savage era, [[domestication of animals]], [[agriculture]], and [[metalworking]] in the barbarian era and the [[alphabet]] and [[writing]] in the civilization era. 

Instead of specific inventions, White decided that the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]]. For White, &quot;the primary function of culture&quot; is to &quot;harness and control energy.&quot; White differentiates between five stages of human development: In the first, people use energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[nuclear energy]].  [[Craig Brownell]] suggests that there could be a sixth stage in this series:  the utilisation of [[zero-point]] vacuum quantum fluctuation energy, for propulsion if not actual power generation.  There is much debate over whether [[Casimir effect]]s can be exploited, however.

[[Image:PPTPatentsLOG-25.jpg|thumb|left|200px|US [[Patent]]s granted, 1870&amp;ndash;2005]]

White introduced a formula P=ET, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilizing the energy. In his own words, &quot;culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased.&quot; The Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated this theory to create the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations. A [[Dyson sphere]] is Type II on this scale, and humanity is currently at about 0.72.

Lenski takes a more modern approach and focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], they can [[learn]] and pass information by experience. In the third, the humans start using [[signs]] and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in the technology of communication translates into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of goods]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial (5) special (like fishing societies).

==Kurzweil and ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''==

Kurzweil in his 2001 essay [http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0134.html?printable=1 ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'' ] extends [[Moore's law]] to describe an [[exponential growth]] of [[technology|technological]] progress. Moore's law describes an exponential growth pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Kurzweil extends this to include technologies from far before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to &quot;technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history.&quot; He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, in 2045.

The essay begins:

{{cquote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century&amp;mdash;it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to [[the Singularity]]&amp;mdash;technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[moore's law|Moore's]]. It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology, when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many futurists still use the term &quot;Moore's Law&quot; to describe ideas like those put forth by Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (''intentionally to design with efficiency'') a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, ''i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers'', each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==

Some claim the [[exponential growth]] of technological progress may become linear or inflected or may begin to flatten into a limited-growth curve. In this model, instead of an overall acceleration of progress, technological advance jumps forward whenever there is a human &quot;buy in&quot; and stalls whenever there is no benefit large enough to [[Profit (economics)|profit]] the technologists. As a result, the sequence of changes never gets steep enough to become a singularity. 

Examples of large human &quot;buy-ins&quot; into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and [[Jonathan Huebner]] have argued&amp;mdash;each from different perspectives&amp;mdash;that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. The validity of their conclusions has been [http://accelerating.org/articles/huebnerinnovation.html criticized] by [[John Smart (futurist)|John Smart]].

Choosing technological &quot;milestones&quot;, defining the meaning of technological &quot;growth&quot;, and similar semantic exercises often include significant subjectivity, and are therefore easily criticized. For example, it can be claimed that inventions are generally created by a fixed population of human inventors at a constant rate, regardless of their current technological prowess, and therefore technological &quot;progress&quot; is actually a function of population growth, not past inventions.

In fact, &quot;[[technological singularity]]&quot; is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D. Sornette. 2001. Finite-time Singularity in the Dynamics of the World Population and Economic Indices. ''Physica A'' 294(3–4): 465–502&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=37484&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=Found ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.''] Moscow: URSS, 2006; Andrey Korotayev. The [[World-systems theory|World System]] [[urbanization]] dynamics. [http://edurss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53185&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=Found History &amp; Mathematics: Historical Dynamics and Development of Complex Societies]. Edited by [[Peter Turchin]], Leonid Grinin, Andrey Korotayev, and Victor C. de Munck. Moscow: KomKniga, 2006. ISBN 5484010020. P. 44-62
&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the &quot;blow-up regime&quot; (implying just finite-time singularities). In our case this nonlinear second order [[positive feedback]] looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving &quot;from singularity&quot;, rather than &quot;toward singularity&quot;.

[[Juergen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity [[Omega]], referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040 he says the series Omega - 2^n human lifetimes (n&lt;10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]]. But he also questions the validity of such lists, suggesting they just reflect a general rule for ''&quot;both the individual memory of single humans and the collective memory of entire societies and their history books: constant amounts of memory space get allocated to exponentially larger, adjacent  time intervals further and further into the past.&quot;'' He suggests that this may be the reason ''&quot;why there has never been a shortage of [[prophets]] predicting that the end is near -  the important events according to one's own view of the past always seem to accelerate exponentially.&quot;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The history of life on Earth seems to show a clear trend; for example, it seems obvious that there is a trend towards increasing complexity in living organisms. More recent organisms, such as [[mammal]]s, appear to be much more complex than older organisms, such as [[bacteria]]. However, there are [[Theory|theoretical]] and [[empirical]] problems with this claim. From a theoretical perspective, it appears that there is no reason to expect evolution to result in any largest-scale trends, although small-scale trends, limited in time and space, are expected ([[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]], 1997). From an empirical perspective, it is difficult to measure complexity and, when it has been measured, the evidence does not support a largest-scale trend (McShea, 1996).

==Hypothetical largest-scale trends==

McShea (1998) discusses eight features of organisms that might indicate largest-scale trends in evolution: 

* [[entropy]]
* energy intensiveness
* evolutionary versatility
* developmental depth
* structural depth
* adaptedness
* size
* [[complexity]]

He calls these &quot;live hypotheses&quot;, meaning that trends in these features are currently being considered by evolutionary biologists. McShea observes that the most popular hypothesis, among scientists, is that there is a largest-scale trend towards increasing complexity.

==History of the idea of evolutionary progress==

Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Teilhard de Chardin|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Henri Bergson]]. Even [[Charles Darwin]] seems to have believed in some form of progress (Darwin, 1859):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Chapter 10] The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, insofar, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Chapter 14] As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Michael Ruse|Ruse]] (1997) presents a detailed and carefully researched survey of the idea of progress in evolutionary biology. He argues that belief in evolutionary progress is still prevalent among evolutionary biologists today, although it is often denied or veiled. Ruse (1997) writes, &quot;A major conclusion of this study is that some of the most significant of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work.&quot; He claims that progressionism has harmed the status of evolutionary biology as a mature, professional science.

In examining the issue of evolutionary progress, the first step is to define progress. [[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala]] (1988) defines progress as &quot;systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature.&quot; He argues that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggests that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is &quot;improvement&quot;. This may be compared to Gould's suggestion of &quot;replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality&quot;. 

Dawkins, on the other hand, proposes that Darwinian evolution is fundamentally progressive if progress is simply defined as &quot;an increase, not in complexity, intelligence or some other anthropocentric value, but in the accumulating number of features contributing towards whatever adaptation the lineage in question exemplifies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Reviews/1997-06fullhouse.shtml Human Chauvinism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary theorists agree that there are local trends in evolution, such as increasing [[brain]] size in [[hominid]]s, but these directional changes do not persist indefinitely, and trends in opposite directions also occur ([[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]], 1997). Evolution causes organisms to adapt to their local environment; when the environment changes, the direction of the trend may change. The question of whether there is evolutionary progress is better formulated as the question of whether there are any [[Largest-Scale Trends in Evolution|largest-scale trends in evolution]] (McShea, 1998). That is, is there a consistent directional change throughout the history of life on Earth?

==Theoretical perspective==

Organisms adapt to their local environment. As long as the local environment is stable, we can expect to observe small-scale trends, as organisms become increasingly adapted to the local environment. [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] (1997) argues that there are no global (largest-scale) trends in evolution, because traits that are advantageous for some local environment are detrimental for some other local environment. 

Although it is difficult to measure complexity, it seems uncontroversial that mammals are more complex than bacteria. Gould (1997) agrees, but claims that this apparent largest-scale trend is a [[Artifact (observational)|statistical artifact]]. Bacteria represent a minimum level of complexity for life on Earth today. Gould (1997) argues that there is no [[Selection|selective pressure]] for higher levels of complexity, but there is selective pressure against complexity below the level of bacteria. This minimum required level of complexity, combined with random [[mutation]], implies that the average level of complexity of life must increase over time. Gould (1997) uses the analogy of a [[random walk]] that begins near a wall. Although the walk is random, the walker cannot pass through the wall, so we should expect the walker to move increasingly further from the wall as time passes. This does not imply that the walker is driven away from the wall. The wall is analogous to the complexity level of bacteria. We should expect evolution to wander increasingly further from this level of complexity, but it does not imply that evolution is driven towards increasing complexity.

In response to Gould's (1997) critique, Turney (2000) presents a computational model in which there is a largest-scale trend towards increasing evolutionary versatility. This trend requires continual change. Although this model shows that largest-scale trends are compatible with evolutionary theory, the model has not yet been empirically confirmed.

==Empirical perspective==

Evolutionary theory might not predict largest-scale trends, but there may be such trends nonetheless. McShea (1996) looks at the empirical evidence for a trend towards increasing complexity in Metazoan fossils. He concludes that the evidence is not decisive and further investigation is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hybrid speciation''' is the process wherein [[hybridization]] between two different closely related [[species]] leads to a distinct [[phenotype]]. This phenotype in very rare cases can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such [[natural selection]] may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if [[reproductive isolation]] is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid [[speciation]] is considered an extremely rare event. 

Hybridization without change in [[chromosome]] number is called [[homoploid]] hybrid speciation. It is considered very rare but has been shown in ''[[Heliconius]]'' [[butterfly|butterflies]] and in [[sunflower]]s. [[Polyploid]] speciation, which involves changes in chromosome number, is a more common phenomenon, especially in plant species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Much writing has been devoted to '''entropy and life'''. Research concerning the relationship between the thermodynamic quantity [[entropy]] and the [[evolution]] of [[life]] began in around the turn of the 20th century.  In 1910, American historian [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] printed and distributed to university libraries and history professors the small volume ''A Letter to American Teachers of History'' proposing a theory of [[history]] based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the principle of [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1986). History of the United States of America During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson (pg. 1299). Library of America.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Henry. (1910).

Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 book [[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]] by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] served largely to stimulate this research.  In this book, Schrödinger states that life feeds on negative entropy, or [[negentropy]] as it is sometimes called.  Recent writings have utilized the concept of [[Gibbs free energy]] to elaborate on this issue.

==Origin==
In 1863, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published his noted memoir &quot;On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of its Action&quot; wherein he outlined a preliminary relationship, as based on his own work and that of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], between his newly developed concept of entropy and life.  Building on this, one of the first to speculate on a possible thermodynamic perspective of [[evolution]] was the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].  In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig  | title = The second law of thermodynamics (Theoretical physics and philosophical problems)| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | year = 1974 | id = ISBN 9789027702500}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{cquote|The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials – these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available – nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a ''struggle for [negative] entropy'', which becomes available through the transition of energy from the ''hot sun'' to the ''cold earth''.}} 

[[Image:Solar-gradient.jpg|650px|center|thumb|The [[solar system]] from a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic systems]] perspective.]]

==Early views==
In 1876, American civil engineer [[Richard Sears McCulloch]], in his ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam-Engine'', which was an early thermodynamics textbook, states, after speaking about the laws of the physical world, that &quot;there are none that are established on a firmer basis than the two general propositions of [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]; which constitute the fundamental laws of our subject.&quot;  McCulloch then goes on to show that these two laws may be combined in a single expression as follows:

::&lt;math&gt; S = \int { dQ \over \tau } &lt;/math&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; = [[entropy]]
::&lt;math&gt; dQ &lt;/math&gt; = equals a differential amount of [[heat]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]
::&lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; = [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]

McCulloch then declares that the applications of these two laws, i.e. what are currently known as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], are innumerable.  He then states:

{{cquote|When we reflect how generally physical phenomena are connected with thermal changes and relations, it at once becomes obvious that there are few, if any, branches of [[natural science]]  which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration.  Nor should it, therefore, be a matter of surprise that already, in the short space of time, not yet one generation, elapsed since the [[Theory of heat|mechanical theory of heat]] has been freely adopted, whole branches of physical science have been revolutionized by it.}}

McCulloch then gives a few examples of what he calls the “more interesting examples” of the application of these laws in extent and utility.  The first example he gives, is [[physiology]] wherein he states that “the body of an animal, not less than a steamer, or a locomotive, is truly a [[heat engine]], and the consumption of food in the one is precisely analogous to the burning of fuel in the other; in both, the [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is the same: that called [[combustion]].”  He then incorporates a discussion of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]’s theory of respiration with cycles of digestion and excretion, perspiration, but then contradicts Lavoisier with recent findings, such as internal heat generated by friction, according to the new [[theory of heat]], which, according to McCulloch, states that the “heat of the body generally and uniformly is diffused instead of being concentrated in the chest”.  McCulloch then gives an example of the second law, where he states that [[friction]], especially in the smaller blooded-vessels, must develop heat.  Without doubt, animal heat is thus in part produced. He then asks: “but whence the expenditure of energy causing that friction, and which must be itself accounted for?&quot;

To answer this question he turns to the mechanical theory of heat and goes on to loosely outline how the heart is what he calls a “force-pump”, which receives blood and sends it to every part of the body, as discovered by [[William Harvey]], that “acts like the piston of an engine and is dependent upon and consequently due to the cycle of nutrition and excretion which sustains physical or organic life.”  It is likely, here, that McCulloch was modeling parts of this argument on that of the famous [[Carnot cycle]].  In conclusion, he summarizes his first and second law argument as such:

{{cquote|Everything physical being subject to the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], it follows that no physiological action can take place except with expenditure of [[energy]] derived from food; also, that an animal performing [[mechanical work]] must from the same quantity of food generate less heat than one abstaining from exertion, the difference being precisely the [[Mechanical equivalent of heat|heat equivalent]] of that of work.}}

==What is life?==
Later, building on this premise, in the famous 1944 book [[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What is Life?]], [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schrödinger]] theorizes that [[life]], contrary to the general tendency dictated by the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], decreases or maintains its entropy by feeding on [[negative entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schrödinger | first = Erwin  | title = What is Life - the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1944 | isbn = 0-521-42708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a note to ''What is Life?'', however, Schrödinger explains his usage of this term: 

{{cquote|Let me say first, that if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}  

This is what is argued to differentiate [[life]] from other forms of [[matter]] organization.  In this direction, although life's dynamics may be argued to go against the tendency of second law, which states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase, it does not in any way conflict or invalidate this law, because the principle that entropy can only increase or remain constant applies only to a [[closed system]] which is adiabatically isolated, meaning no [[heat]] can enter or leave.  Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denbigh&quot;&gt;  The common justification for this argument, for example, according to renowned chemical engineer Kenneth Denbigh, from his 1955 book ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', is that &quot;living organisms are [[open system (systems theory)|open]] to their environment and can build up at the expense of foodstuffs which they take in and degrade.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[James Lovelock]] was among a group of scientists who were requested by [[NASA]] to make a theoretical life detection system to look for [[life on Mars]] during the upcoming space mission.  When thinking about this problem, Lovelock wondered “how can we be sure that Martian life, if any, will reveal itself to tests based on Earth’s lifestyle?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovelock | first = James | title = GAIA - A New Look at Life on Earth | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-19-286218-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Lovelock, the basic question was “What is life, and how should it be recognized?”  When speaking about this puzzling issue with some of his colleagues at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], he was asked, well what would you do to look for life on Mars?  To this Lovelock replied:

{{cquote|I’d look for an entropy reduction, since this must be a general characteristic of life.}}

Thus, according to Lovelock, to find signs of life, one must look for a “reduction or a reversal of entropy.”

==Gibbs free energy==
In recent years, the thermodynamic interpretation of evolution in relation to entropy has begun to utilize the concept of the [[Gibbs free energy]], rather than entropy. This is because biological processes on earth take place at roughly constant temperature and pressure, a situation in which the Gibbs free energy is an especially useful way to express the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The Gibbs free energy is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta G \equiv \Delta H-T \Delta S \,&lt;/math&gt; 

The minimization of the Gibbs free energy is a form of the [[principle of minimum energy]], which follows from the [[entropy maximization principle]] for closed systems.  Moreover, the Gibbs free energy equation, in modified form, can be utilized for [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] when [[chemical potential]] terms are included in the energy balance equation. In a popular 1982 textbook ''Principles of Biochemistry'' by noted American biochemist [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]], it is argued that the order produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the disorder they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division.  In short, according to Lehninger, &quot;living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lehninger | first = Albert  | title = Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-87901-711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, according to the chemist [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], from his recent 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', we find a presentation in which the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution, as well as human cultural evolution, has its basis in the background of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]].  The (apparent) paradox between the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems, according to Avery, has its resolution &quot;in the information content of the [[Gibbs free energy]] that enters the biosphere from outside sources.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avery | first = John  | title = Information Theory and Evolution | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 981-238-399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of natural selection responsible for such local increase in order may be mathematically derived directly from the expression of the second law equation for connected non-equilibrium open systems &lt;ref&gt;doi:10.1098/rspa.2008.0178 &quot;Natural selection for least action&quot;, Ville R. I. Kaila and Arto Annila; Proceedings of the Royal Society A.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Human Vestigial Response: Ear Perking  
  
It has been observed that some people have slight protrusions on the outer ear, also known as the auricle. These protrusions tend towards the top of the auricle. This has been tagged and coined [[Darwin's tubercle]] of the auricle. This phenomenon jibes with the accepted scientific explanation: the incidence of tubercles of the auricle among humans, are [[vestigial structure]]s testifying to our evolutionary past. They are a throwback to the pointed ears of many mammals and just one more vestigial trace of man's evolutionary history.

The focus on this part of the human anatomy has finally been followed by a much later observation testifying to our evolutionary past. The subsequent observation concerns an automatic ear-perking response seen, for example, in dogs when startled by a sudden noise. This response, though faint, fleeting and hardly discernible in humans nonetheless clearly manifests itself. This phenomenon which is an automatic-response mechanism &quot;kicks-in&quot; even before a human becomes consciously aware that a startling, unexpected or unknown sound has been &quot;heard&quot;.

That this vestigial response occurs even before becoming consciously aware of a startling noise would explain why the function of ear-perking had evolved in animals. The mechanism serves to give a split-second advantage to a startled animal – possibly an animal being stalked and hunted. The evolutionary advantage of the ear-perking response could spell the difference between life and death. The perking response serves to gather and focus that much more audible information that is fed into the brain and on its way to being analyzed even before the animal actually becomes aware of the sound. This fraction-of-a-second advantage would explain the evolutionary selection for this response.

==History ==

&quot;Dysgenic&quot; was first used, as an adjective, around 1915, by [[David Starr Jordan]], describing the &quot;dysgenic effect&quot; of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan believed that fit men were as likely to die in [[modern warfare]] as anyone else, and that war killed only the physically fit men of the populace whilst preserving the disabled at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Jordan| first = David Starr| title = War and the Breed: The Relation of War to the Downfall of Nations| publisher = University Press of the Pacific| date= 2003 (Reprint)| location = Honolulu, Hawaii| isbn = 1-4102-0900-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McNish I|title=David Starr Jordan on the Dysgenic effects of dysfunctional culture|journal= Mankind Quarterly|date = Fall 2002|volume=43|issue=1|pages=81–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 Colum Gillfallen speculated in ''[[The Mankind Quarterly]]'' that [[lead]] used by Romans in [[plumbing]] and [[cooking]] utensils poisoned the water and food of the Roman elite, causing the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Gillfallen SC| title = Roman Culture and Dysgenic Lead Poisoning| journal = The Mankind Quarterly| volume = 5| issue = 3| pages = 131–148| date=  January–March 1965| id = ISSN 0025-2344}} &lt;/ref&gt; Gillfallen's theory was refuted in 1985 by Needleman and Needleman, who showed that measurements of lead from bones of Romans and other peoples provide no evidence that the fertility of the Roman elite was adversely affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Needleman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Needleman L, Needleman D| title = Lead Poisoning and the Decline of the Roman Aristocracy| journal = Classical Views| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 63–94| date=  1985| id = ISSN 0012-9356}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Shockley]] used the term in his controversial advocacy of [[eugenics]] from the mid-1960s through the 1980s. Shockley argued that &quot;the future of the population was threatened because people with low [[IQ]]s had more children than those with high IQs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = William Shockley 1910–1989| work = A Science Odyssey People and Discoveries| publisher = PBS online| date=  1998| url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/btshoc.html| accessdate = 2006-11-13}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Shockley&quot;&gt;[[William Shockley]], [[Roger Pearson]]: ''Shockley on Eugenics and Race: The Application of Science to the Solution of Human Problems'' [[Scott-Townsend Publishers]], ISBN 978-1878465030&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Klark Graham]] in 1998 argued that [[genocide]] and [[Class conflict|class warfare]], in cases ranging from the [[French Revolution]] to the present, have had a dysgenic effect through the killing of the more intelligent by the less intelligent, and &quot;might well incline humanity toward a more primitive, more brutish level of evolutionary achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Graham RK|title=Devolution by revolution: Selective genocide ensuing from the French and Russian revolutions|journal=Mankind Quarterly|date=Fall 1998|volume=39|issue=11|pages=71–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1969, a few studies on differential fertility have theorized that it may lead to a decline in population IQ and isolated studies have reported a negative correlation between [[IQ]] and [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Flynn effect==
The rise in IQ scores since their development provides evidence against dysgenic declines in IQ; this general rising trend is known as the [[Flynn effect]]. [[Genetics|Geneticist]] Steve Connor, wrote that Lynn's 1996 book &quot;misunderstood modern ideas of genetics&quot;. &quot;A flaw in his argument of genetic deterioration in intelligence&quot;, Jones said in his refutation of the existence of a dysgenic trend, &quot;was the widely accepted fact that intelligence as measured by IQ tests has actually increased over the past 50 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last = Connor | first =Steve | title = Stalking the Wild Taboo; Professor predicts genetic decline and fall of man  | work =The Sunday Times | date = December 22, 1996 | url = http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/late/dysg_sc.html | accessdate = 2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the genes underlying IQ have been shifting, IQ throughout the population should reasonably be expected to shift in the same direction, yet the reverse has occurred. However, [[Genotype|genotypic]] IQ may fall even while [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] IQ rises throughout the population due to environmental effects such as better schooling, nutrition and television viewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3217809&quot; &gt;{{cite journal |author=Retherford RD, Sewell WH |title=Intelligence and family size reconsidered |journal=Soc Biol |volume=35 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–40 |year=1988 |pmid=3217809|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Retherford-Sewell_Intelligence.Family.S.R.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flynn Effect]] has increased IQ scores as much as 15 points throughout the [[First World]], but some researchers have argued that this trend now shows signs of reversal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Flynn himself has recently argued that the Flynn effect does not show a real increase in intelligence over time, as if it were so then intelligence in past centuries would be implausibly low. Instead, he believes the effect is due to a bias in IQ tests towards abstract reasoning, which has improved during the 20th century due to education and technology. People in past centuries perhaps had similar intelligence to those today, but were not as proficient at abstract reasoning.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

==Dysgenic fallacy==
A negative [[correlation]] between [[Fertility and intelligence|fertility and IQ]] has existed in many parts of the world at various times;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/1972320 Literacy, Education and Fertility, Past and Present: A Critical Review, Harvey J. Graff]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that this was true of [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Needleman&quot;/&gt; While it may seem obvious that differential fertility would result in a progressive change in IQ, Preston and Campbell argue that it is a fallacy that applies only to closed subpopulations. As long as the children's IQ can be higher or lower than that of their parents, an equilibrium is established. Subsequently, the [[mean]] IQ will not change, in the absence of a change in the differential fertility. The steady-state IQ distribution will be lower for negative differential fertility and for positive, but these differences are small. For the extreme, and unrealistic assumption, of [[Endogamy|endogamous]] mating in IQ subgroups, a differential fertility change of 2.5/1.5 to 1.5/2.5 (high IQ/low IQ), causes a maximum shift of four IQ points. For random mating, the shift is less than one IQ point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Preston SH, Campbell C  | title =Differential Fertility and the Distribution of Traits: The Case of IQ | journal =The American Journal of Sociology | volume =98 |issue =5  | pages =997–1019 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | date =March 1993  | url =http://www.jstor.org/pss/2781579  | accessdate = 2008-04-22 |format = fee required|doi=10.1086/230135}} &lt;/ref&gt;

James S. Coleman, however, contends that Preston and Campbell's model depends on assumptions which are unlikely to be true, and argues that their dismissal of the &quot;common belief&quot; in the case of IQ is unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Coleman JS | date = 1993 | title = Comment on Preston and Campbell's 'Differential Fertility and the Distribution of Traits' | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages =1020–1032 | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/2781580|format=fee required | doi = 10.1086/230136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lam D| title =Comment on Preston and Campbell's &quot;Differential Fertility and the Distribution of Traits&quot; | journal =The American Journal of Sociology | volume=98 |issue=5 | pages =1033–1039 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] | date =March 1993 | url =http://www.jstor.org/pss/2781581 | accessdate = 2008-04-22|format=fee required | doi=10.1086/230137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]]'s 1951 short story ''[[The Marching Morons]]'' is an example of dysgenic fiction, describing a man who accidentally ends up in the distant future to find out that dysgenics has resulted in mass stupidity. [[Mike Judge]]'s 2006 film ''[[Idiocracy]]'' has the same premise, with the main character the subject of a military [[hibernation]] experiment that goes awry, taking him 500 years into the future. While in the Kornbluth short story civilization is kept afloat by a small group of dedicated geniuses, their role has been replaced by advanced [[automation|automated systems]] in ''Idiocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/business/09online.html |title=Shying away from Degeneracy|work=The New York Times|author=Mitchell, Dan|date=2006-09-09|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SailerTAC&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Steve Sailer|Sailer S]]|url=http://www.isteve.com/Film_Idiocracy.htm |title=The Morons Shall Inherit the Earth|work=The American Conservative|date=2006-10-06|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|300px| '''Pithecometra''': In the frontispiece from his 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'', Huxley compared skeletons of apes to humans.]]

The '''Pithecometra principle''' or '''Pithecometra thesis''' ({{lang-de|Pithecometra-Satz}}) describes the evolution of mankind; the pithecometra law is analogous to the concept that '''''&quot;man evolved from apes&quot;''''' or '''''&quot;man descended from apes&quot;''''' as advocated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].

In evolution, Huxley first developed the concept of the &quot;Pithecometra principle&quot; which was discussed by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]], when Huxley wrote the 1863 essay &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; stating that mankind was more closely related to apes than the apes were to monkeys.
&lt;ref name=HuxAI&gt;
     &quot;Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record&quot; (history),
     by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ''ArchaeologyInfo.com'' webpage:
     [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/perspectives003.htm ArchaeologyInfo-003].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huxley added that to hunt evidence of this close ancestry between apes and humans, the regions where modern apes are found should be the focal point, hence, [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt;

The ''pithecometra principle'' has been most notable in [[evolution theory]] by placing mankind as an offshoot of animal species, rather than a separate divine creation, and thus ''pithecometra'' has generated intense religious controversy for decades.

== Impact ==
Another of Darwin’s colleagues was [[Ernst Haeckel|Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834-1919).&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; Haeckel agreed with Huxley on several aspects of the pithecometra thesis. However, Haeckel frequently lectured on the Asian origin of the &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; Consequently, [[Eugene Dubois]], a student of Haeckel’s indoctrinated with the idea of Asian hominid origins, traveled to Java, Indonesia in 1890-1892. It was during this expedition when Dubois made the incredible discovery of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' [[fossil]]s in [[Asia]]. Also known as ''[[Java Man]]'', that specimen was validation of mankind’s deep ancestry outside of Europe.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt;

The pithecometra thesis with the work of Darwin, Huxley and Haeckel helped liberate the European scientific community of its Eurocentric biases.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; However, their work did not directly produce a change. It required the later revolution in evolutionary thought, of the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis of the mid-1900s, to cause a change in the recovery of fossils from regions outside Europe. Evidence of refusals to accept the fossils that began to be found in Asia and Africa after the late 1800s was the Piltdown Hoax.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt;

The perpetrator of the Piltdown hoax is uncertain but the year and location indicate a rejection of growing evidence for man’s ancestry outside of Europe. In 1912 in England, a fossil was presented and named ''Piltdown Man''.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; This specimen was the combination of ape and human features the scientific community had been seeking in order to argue human/ape affinities. The high, globular braincase signified human-like features while the robust jaw and molars resembled ape skulls. This fossil was used as proof of human evolution having occurred in England. With the discovery of the Piltdown specimen, actual fossil specimens of the prehistoric [[australopithecine]] [[genus]] coming from Africa were being ignored.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; [[Raymond Dart]], who obtained a fossil skull of an actual [[hominid]] showing human-ape affinities from [[South Africa]] was treated with disdain.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; Later in the 1950s, as the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis had thoroughly saturated the European scientific community, fewer people chose to ignore the significant [[Australopithecus]] fossils coming from Africa, and the Piltdown Man fossil was re-examined. Upon closer inspection, the cranium was judged to be of a modern human and the jaw matched a modern [[orangutan]].&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt; The molars had been filed down to appear like human upper molars, and the surface of the Piltdown specimen had been painted to give it the illusion of having been buried a long time. The rejection of the Piltdown fossil in the 1950s removed a significant barrier that had blocked the European scientific community’s view of more accurate human origins.&lt;ref name=HuxAI/&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Enquiry into the '''evolution of ageing''' aims to explain why almost all [[life|living things]] weaken and [[death|die]] with age.  There is not yet agreement in the [[scientific community]] on a single answer.  The [[evolution]]ary origin of [[senescence]] remains a fundamental unsolved problem in [[biology]].

Historically, [[ageing]] was first likened to &quot;wear and tear&quot;: living bodies get weaker just as with use a knife's edge becomes dulled or with exposure to air and moisture iron objects rust.  But this idea was discredited in the 19th century when the [[second law of thermodynamics]] was formalized.  [[Entropy]] (disorder) must increase inevitably ''within a closed system'', but living beings are not [[closed system]]s.  It is a defining feature of life that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste.  Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. There is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence. In addition, generic damage or &quot;wear and tear&quot; theories could not explain why biologically similar organisms (e.g. mammals) exhibited such dramatically different life spans.
 

==History==

[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework.  In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theater to make room for the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Weismann A. 1889.  ''Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems.''  Clarendon Press, Oxford. Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a [[teleological]] or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a ''purpose'' for ageing has been identified, but not a ''mechanism'' by which that purpose could be achieved.  Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes.  (In fact, there is every reason to think that the opposite is true: ageing ''decreases'' individual fitness.)  Weismann disavowed his own theory before his life was over.

Theories suggesting that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design (such as Weismann's &quot;programmed death&quot; theory) are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing. The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century but is now experiencing a resurgence because of new empirical evidence as well as new thinking regarding the process of evolution.

==Mutation accumulation==

The first modern, successful theory of ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952.  His idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect.  Nature is a highly competitive place, and almost all animals in nature die before they attain old age.  Therefore, there is not much motivation to keep the body fit for the long haul - not much selection pressure for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would be dead anyway, killed by predators or disease or by accident.  

Medawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation''. The mechanism of action involves random, detrimental mutations of a kind that happen to show their effect only late in life.  Unlike most detrimental mutations, these would not be efficiently weeded out by natural selection.  Hence they would 'accumulate' and, perhaps, cause all the decline and damage that we associate with ageing.&lt;ref&gt;Medawar, P.B. 1952. ''An Unsolved Problem of Biology.'' London: H.K. Lewis. [http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Medawar-UPB.pdf]
Edney, E.B. and Gill, R.W. 1968. Delineates the theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of senescence and specific longevity. ''Nature'', '''220''': 281-282. Further describes theory of mutation accumulation.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This theory was further developed by [[George C. Williams]] in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many  deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age'.  In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose a bit of its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully.  Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection.  Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that even a little bit of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.

Williams's objection has turned out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature.  These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory.  Another problem with this theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available.  It turns out that the genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as [[eukaryotic]] life.  Baker's [[yeast]], [[worm]]s, [[Fruit fly|fruit flies]], and [[mice]] all share some of the same ageing genes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarente, L and Kenyon, C.  2000. Genetic pathways that regulate ageing in model organisms. ''Nature'' '''408''':255-262 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v408/n6809/abs/408255a0.html] Shows similarities between ageing genes in model organisms.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medawar's concept suggested that the evolution process was affected by the age at which an organism was capable of reproducing.  Characteristics that adversely affected an organism prior to that age would severely limit the organism's ability to propagate its characteristics and thus would be highly &quot;selected against&quot; by [[natural selection]].  Characteristics that caused the same adverse effects that only appeared well after that age would have relatively little effect on the organism's ability to [[propagate]]. This concept fit well with the observed multiplicity of mammal life spans (and differing ages of sexual maturity) and is important to all of the subsequent theories of aging discussed below.

==Antagonistic pleiotropy==

Williams (1957) proposed his own theory, called ''[[Pleiotropy|antagonistic pleiotropy]]''.  Pleiotropy means one gene that has two or more effects on the [[phenotype]].  In antagonistic pleiotropy, one of these effects is beneficial and another is detrimental.  In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on.  If evolution is a race to have the most offspring the fastest, then enhanced early fertility could be selected even if it came with a price tag that included decline and death later on.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. [http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf] Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonistic pleiotropy is the prevailing theory today, but this is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified.  In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently.  Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits.  But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified.  This is not what Williams predicted.  This may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.

Another difficulty with antagonistic pleiotropy and other theories that suppose that ageing is an adverse side-effect of some beneficial function is that the linkage between adverse and beneficial effects would need to be ''rigid'' in the sense that the evolution process would not be able to eventually find a way to accomplish the benefit without incurring the adverse effect. Such a rigid relationship has not been experimentally demonstrated and, in general, evolution is obviously able to independently and individually adjust myriad organism characteristics.

In breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long life span.  Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their fertility.  His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies.  This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Leroi, A.M., Chippindale, A.K. and Rose, M.R. 1994.

==Disposable soma theory==

{{Original research|date=July 2008}}

A third mainstream theory of ageing, the ''Disposable soma'' theory, proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], presumes that the body must budget the amount of energy available to it.  The body uses food energy for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance.  With a finite supply of food, the body must compromise, and do none of these things quite as well as it would like.  It is the compromise in allocating energy to the repair function that causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304.
[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''disposable soma'' came from the analogy with disposable products -- why spend money making something durable, if it will
only be used for a limited amount of time? 

The disposable soma theory has great appeal because its basis is so sensible and intuitive, but there are arguments against it. The theory clearly predicts that a shortage of food should make the compromise more severe all around; but in many experiments, ongoing since 1930, it has been demonstrated that animals live longer when fed substantially less than controls.  This is the [[caloric restriction]] (CR) effect,&lt;ref&gt;Weindruch, R. and Walford, R.L. 1986. ''The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction.'' Springfield, IL: Thomas.
Masoro, E.J. 2005. ''Mechanisms of Aging and Development'' '''126''': 913-922.
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15885745&amp;dopt=Abstract] Overview of caloric restriction and aging.&lt;/ref&gt; and it cannot be easily reconciled with the Disposable Soma theory. Though by decreasing energy expenditure the damage generated (by [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] for instance) is expected to be reduced and the total energy budget might indeed be reduced, but the investment in repair function might still be relatively the same. But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower reproductive output is also lower. So CR does thus not completely dismiss disposable theory.  

Experimentally, some animals lose fertility when their [[Maximum life span|life span]]s are extended by CR and some suffer no appreciable loss.  Males, for example, typically remain fertile when underfed, while females do not.  And, even females present an enigma because their fertility decline is not tightly coupled to their longevity gain.  For example, in female mice that are restricted to 60% of a free-feeding diet, reproduction is shut down altogether. But female life span continues to increase linearly right up to the threshold of starvation - around 30% of free-feeding levels.

A difficulty with the disposable soma theory is that the energy required for maintenance and repair would appear to be relatively minor when compared to the energy required for gestation (repair should take less energy then producing an entire new organism). Yet gestating animals seem able to perform the maintenance while post-reproductive animals do not.  A similar difficulty is that male animals seem to have similar life spans as females despite the apparently higher energy requirement for gestation and other reproductive activities.

==Problems with the theories==
{{Weasel|date=May 2008}}
A fundamental embarrassment for all three mainstream theories is that there appear to be 'deliberate' metabolic features, mechanisms that seem to have no other purpose than to cause death.  

One is ''[[apoptosis]]'', or programmed cell death.  Apoptosis is responsible for killing infected cells, cancerous cells and cells that are simply in the wrong place during development.  There are clear benefits to apoptosis, so the existence of apoptosis isn't a problem for evolutionary theory.  The problem is that apoptosis seems to ramp up late in life and kill healthy cells, causing weakness and degeneration.  And, paradoxically, apoptosis has been observed as a kind of 'altruistic suicide' in colonies of [[yeast]] under stress.  This seems to be a direct hint that senescence arose because it conferred a direct evolutionary advantage, rather than some kind of side-effect of genes that have other evolutionary advantages (pleiotropy).{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

A second 'deliberate' mechanism is called ''replicative senescence'' or cellular [[senescence]].  Metaphorically, a cell may be said to 'count' (with its ''[[telomeres]]'') the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies.  It has been proposed that this is a last-ditch protective mechanism against cancer.  But this hypothesis fails because replicative senescence is far older than cancer.  Many [[invertebrate]]s experience replicative senescence, though they never die of cancer.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}  Even one-celled organisms count replications, and will die if they don't replenish their telomeres with [[conjugation]] (sex).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press.
[http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html] About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt;

More strictly, of course, cells cannot 'count' the number of times they have divided. Telomeres are not a counting mechanism, though they may be used to indicate the number of times a particular [[chromosome]] has been replicated. Cellular processes for genetic material [[DNA replication|replication]] occurs in both directions along [[DNA]], 5' to 3' and on the other strand, 3' to 5'. As the 3' to 5' end is impossible for [[DNA polymerase]] to grab at the 1 base pair mark, a handful of basepairs (10-15) are cut off each replication. Over time, this cutting short of the DNA results in no telomeres, and the cell is unable to replicate that chromosome without cutting into genes.

The body's [[inflammation]] process exists to fight disease; but the system can turn against us, and does so increasingly with older age, causing heart disease and arthritis.  This happens reliably enough that a low dose of aspirin each day (slightly toning down the inflammatory response in general) is sufficient to measurably reduce incidence of disease and death in older people.  Is inflammation a function that goes haywire after a certain age?  Or is self-destruction an adaptation?

The dilemma is that evolutionary theory says that what is maintained in a lineage is that which ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring.  Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce.  So, according to theory, ageing could ''only'' evolve as a side-effect, or [[epiphenomenon]] of selection.  The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical [[evolution]] theory (See [[neo-Darwinism]] and [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]) is proposed.  Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake. &lt;ref&gt;Mitteldorf, J.  2004. Ageing selected for its own sake. ''Evol. Ecol. Res.'', '''6''':937-953. [http://mathforum.org/~josh/4OwnSake.pdf] On the tension between experimental data and evolutionary theory.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bredesen, D.E.  2004.  The non-existent aging program: how does it work?  ''Aging Cell''. '''3''':255-259. More on the tension between experiment and theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Semelparous]] organisms and others that die suddenly following reproduction (e.g. [[salmon]], [[octopus]], marsupial mouse ([[Brown_Antechinus]]), etc.) also represent instances of organisms whose design incorporates a life span limiting feature.  Sudden death is more obviously an instance of programmed death or a purposeful adaptation than gradual aging. Biological elements clearly associated with evolved mechanisms such as [[hormone]] signalling have been identified in the death mechanisms of organisms such as the [[octopus]]&lt;ref&gt;Wodinsky, J. 1977. ''Hormonal Inhibition of Feeding and Death in Octopus: Control by Optic Gland Secretion.'' Science '''148''':948-951.&lt;/ref&gt;.

For replicative senescence in one-celled organisms, telomeric ageing is clearly a 'feature' of the genetic software, not a bug.  If ageing could evolve in one-celled organisms for the long-term good of the species, and despite its cost to the individual, then why not other forms of ageing that affect higher animals?

==Impact of New Evolution Concepts on Ageing Theories==

Evolved characteristics that limit life span in the absence of some individually beneficial compensating effect violate the generally understood classical rules of [[evolution]].  Believers in classical theory (see [[Neo-Darwinism]] or [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]) believe that any apparently evolved but individually adverse characteristic of an organism must have a compensating benefit to the ability of individual organisms to survive or reproduce.  The disposable soma  and antagonistic pleiotropy theories are examples of such thinking. 

However, there were other apparently individually adverse organism observations such as [[altruism]] and [[sexual reproduction]] that also appeared to conflict with classical theory. In response to these ''other'' conflicts, adjustments to classical theory were proposed.  Various [[group selection]] theories (beginning in 1962) propose that benefit to a group could offset the individually adverse nature of a characteristic such as [[altruism]]. The same principle could be applied to characteristics that limited life span and theories citing group benefits for limited life spans appeared.

[[Evolvability]] theories (beginning in 1995) suggest that a characteristic that increased an organism's ability to evolve could also offset an individual disadvantage and thus be evolved and retained. Multiple evolvability benefits of a limited life span were subsequently proposed in addition to those originally proposed by Weismann in 1882.

If organisms purposely limit their life spans via ageing or semelparous behavior, the associated evolved mechanisms could be very complex just as mechanisms that provide for mentation, vision, digestion, or other biological function are typically very complex. Such a mechanism could involve hormones, signalling, sensing of external conditions, and other complex functions typical of evolved mechanisms.  Such complex mechanisms could explain all of the observations of ageing and semelparous behaviors. 

Theories to the effect that ageing results by default (mutation accumulation) or is an adverse side-effect of some other function are logically much more limited and suffer when compared to empirical evidence of complex mechanisms. The choice of ageing theory therefore is logically essentially determined by one's position regarding evolutionary mechanisms. 

In response to this dilemma, there are theorists who advocate a return to the ideas of Weismann:  'making room' for the next generation. Ageing helps keep the population diverse, mitigating the problem of ''inbreeding depression'', the well-known tendency for offspring of closely-related parents to have excessive genetic defects.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, T. Aging as an Evolved Characteristic – Weismann’s Theory Reconsidered, Medical Hypotheses 2004 62-2 304:308
[http://www.azinet.com/aging/aging-theory3.pdf] Advocates a return to the ideas of Weissmann.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Skulachev, V. Aging is a Specific Biological Function Rather than the Result of a Disorder in Complex Living Systems: Biochemical Evidence in Support of Weismann's Hypothesis,  Moscow State University, 1997
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9467841&amp;dopt=Abstract]. More evidence in support of Weissmann's hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Evolution of Aging, Theodore C. Goldsmith,  ISBN 0978870905, 2006. Work in which Goldsmith further develops his argument.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with such theories is the same one that troubled Weismann: a good evolutionary theory should describe causes, not goals.

==Future research==

A promising theoretical path invokes regulation of [[population dynamics]].  Populations in nature are subject to boom and bust cycles.  Often overpopulation can be punished by famine or by epidemic.  Either one could wipe out an entire population.  Senescence is a means by which a species can 'take control' of its own death rate, and level out the boom-bust cycles.  This story may be more plausible than the Weismann hypothesis as a mechanistic explanation, because it addresses the question of how [[group selection]] can be rapid enough to compete with individual selection.&lt;ref&gt;Mitteldorf, J.  2006. Chaotic population dynamics and the evolution of ageing: proposing a demographic theory of senescence.  ''Evol. Ecol. Res.'', '''8''':561-574
[http://mathforum.org/~josh/LogiSen-EER.pdf] On population dynamics as a mechanism for the evolution of ageing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Is this a plausible mechanism for evolution of senescence?  Does natural selection act at the level of the larger population, and not just one individual at a time?  To accept group selection as an important and general mechanism of evolution would call into question a great body of evolutionary theory.  The consensus among evolutionary biologists is that it is more conservative to deal with the experimental anomalies of ageing one at a time, with special explanations that don't require a revamping of  evolutionary theory. 

In addition to Weismann, some current theorists think that ageing and other mechanisms that act to restrict life span evolved to aid the evolution process, that is, to increase evolvability. Issues mentioned above regarding the feasibility of the evolution of an individually adverse trait such as ageing may eventually be resolved by close studies of inheritance mechanisms. 

Because of the tension between theory and experiment, this is one of the most dynamic areas of modern biology.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2007}}'''The theory of cellularization''' is one of the theories explaining the origin of the [[metazoan]]s. It was first based on [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s assumption that the earliest animals derived from [[ciliate]] [[protozoan]]s. Haeckel later abandoned this idea which is revived by [[Hadzi]] in 1953. According to the theory, a [[multinucleated]] unicellular ciliate ancestor would give rise to organisms similar to modern [[turbellaria]]n [[flatworm]]s by cellularization of the external layer. Recent molecular and morphologic data add increasing evidence against this view, and the alternative [[colonial theory]], also proposed by Haeckel in the 1870s is gaining widespread acceptance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Female sabotage''' is an [[evolutionary theory]] regarding the propensity of certain females to select &quot;burdened&quot; males of their species for mating.

==History==
Soon after [[Charles Darwin]] published his theory of [[Natural Selection]], he was faced with a puzzle.  If natural selection suggests &quot;[[survival of the fittest]],&quot; then why do some males have traits that detract from their survival?  For instance, the [[peacock]] grows a colorful, cumbersome tail that not only attracts [[predator]]s, but makes it difficult for him to escape those predators.  Similarly, the buck grows enormous [[antler]]s which are heavy to carry and can easily become tangled in branches, interfering with effective escape from pursuing [[hunter]]s.

Of course, Darwin knew that there was more to natural selection than simple [[fitness]].  An equally important part of the struggle of life regards reproduction.  In this case, the question becomes, &quot;Why would a female burden her offspring with dangerous traits by mating with a similarly burdened male?&quot;

Noting that the males with burdensome traits are almost entirely those in [[polygamous]] species, where a minority of males generally mate with many females, Darwin had an insight.  He realized that if females found these male burdens more &quot;attractive,&quot; and if that attractiveness resulted in more matings by burdened males, then the increase in matings of a few sons might offset the death of many other sons as a result of the burden.  In effect, if the success of the surviving males produced enough offspring to cover more than the loss of potential offspring from their lost brothers, then the female who mated with a burdened male had chosen correctly.

==The female sabotage theory==
In 1996, however, Joe Abraham presented a re-interpretation of the problem.  In polygamous species, males generally contribute nothing to the nurturing of offspring, but nevertheless continue to consume finite resources.  In such situations, males effectively become competitors with females and young once they are finished mating.  This gives females a reason to sabotage males, and mating gives them an opportunity to do so.  By choosing to mate exclusively with males who are unlikely to survive because of their burdens, the females ensure that as the males die, more food and other resources will remain for females and their young.  Because females are the limiting resource in most species, as their numbers increase, population fitness will also increase.

Just as a given amount of land can only produce a finite amount of grazing, and a limited amount of grazing can only support a limited number of grazing animals, so a given number of grazing animals can only sustain a limited number of predators.  Similar limitations apply to all living things, and are known as the [[carrying capacity]] of a physical area.  If males' burdens are more likely to draw the interest of local predators, then such males effectively shift predation away from females and their young.  In this case, the females and young will gain an added benefit from decreased predation, and enjoy even higher rates of survivability.

Abraham's explanation reunites the major split in [[sexual selection]]--intrasexual selection (male combat) and intersexual selection (female choice)--together under one rubric.  Under female sabotage, the increase in resources becomes the critical factor, and the cause of increased male mortality is secondary.  The theory also offers new, [[feminist]] approaches to [[lek]]s, [[harem]]s, resource guarding and mate location. 

Perhaps the most attractive aspect of Abraham's explanation, however, is that it can easily work with any of the many current theories of sexual selection, and must play some role in them.  An increase in resources and a decrease in predation for females and their young is an inevitable result of increased male mortality, regardless of what mechanism drives females to mate with males carrying burdensome traits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rapid modes of evolution''' have been proposed by several notable biologists ever since [[Charles Darwin]] proposed his theory of [[Evolution|evolutionary descent]] by [[natural selection]]. In his classic volume ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]'' ([[1859]]), Darwin famously and eloquently stressed the gradual nature of descent, writing:

:It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapses of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were. (1859)

Other biologists, for a variety of reasons, have disagreed with Darwin's interpretation of evolutionary change, and have argued for a different picture, drawing upon stable biological continuity which is then interrupted by rapid speciation. Some theories characterize this speciation [[Cladogenesis|cladistically]] (by [[Speciation|splitting]]) or by phyletic transformation ([[anagenesis]]).

==Evolutionary developmental biology==
Recent work in [[developmental biology]] has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of [[Morphogenesis|tissue morphogenesis]] that may underlie such abrupt morphological transitions. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that are actually (not just apparently) non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume ''[[Origination of Organismal Form]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, selection, and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any [[Process (general)|process]] that [[bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

'''Transgressive segregation''' refers to the formation of extreme [[phenotype]]s observed in segregating [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] populations when compared to parental lines.

Hybrid offspring generally possess traits or characteristics seen in ancestral species. These traits might be expected to be subdued or diluted when compared to the original species. Transgressive segregation attempts to explain situations when the converse is true, hybrid offspring that appear to have overstated traits when compared to the parental line.

Transgressive segregation has been hypothesized as an important mechanism by which novel [[adaptation]]s observed in hybrids can arise. 

There are many mechanisms that could be responsible for transgressive segregation in hybrids such as: an elevated [[mutation]] rate, reduced developmental stability, [[epistasis|epistatic]] effects between [[allele]]s, [[overdominance]] caused by heterozygosity at specific loci or chromosome number variation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rieseberg&quot;&gt;Rieseberg, L.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ring species diagram.svg|thumb|300px|In this diagram, interbreeding populations are represented by coloured blocks. Variation along a cline may bend right around, forming a ring.]]
In [[biology]], a '''ring species''' is a connected series of neighboring populations that can interbreed with relatively closely related populations, but for which there exist at least two &quot;end&quot; populations in the series that are too distantly related to interbreed.  Often such non-breeding-though-genetically-connected populations co-exist in the same region thus creating a &quot;ring&quot;. Ring species provide important evidence of [[evolution]] in that they illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, and are special because they represent in living populations what normally happens over time between long deceased ancestor populations and living populations.

Ring species also present an interesting problem for those who seek to divide the living world into discrete [[species]], as well as for those who believe that evolution does not create new species.  After all, all that distinguishes a ring species from two separate species is the existence of the connecting populations - if enough of the connecting populations within the ring perish to sever the breeding connection, the ring species becomes two distinct species.

==Explanation of  the diagram==

The coloured bar to the right shows a number of natural populations, each population represented by a different colour, varying along a [[cline (population genetics)|cline]] (a gradual change in conditions which gives rise to slightly different characteristics predominating in the organisms that live along it). Such variation may occur in a straight line (for example, up a mountain slope) as is shown in ''A'', or may bend right around (for example, around the shores of a lake), as is shown in ''B''.

In the case where the cline bends around, populations next to each other on the cline can interbreed, but at the point that the beginning meets the end again, as is shown in ''C'', the [[Genetic diversity|genetic differences]] that have accumulated along the cline are great enough to prevent interbreeding (represented by the gap between pink and green on the diagram). The [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]] populations in this circular breeding group are then collectively referred to as a ring species.

==Problem of definition==

The problem, then, is whether to quantify the whole ring as a single species (despite the fact that not all individuals can interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (despite the fact that it can interbreed with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that the species concept is not as clear-cut as it is often thought to be.

==''Larus'' gulls==

[[Image:Rings species example.png|thumb|300px|right|The ''Larus'' gulls interbreed in a ring around the arctic]]
[[Image:PT05 ubt.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|A Herring Gull, ''Larus argentatus'' (front) and a Lesser Black-backed Gull. ''Larus fuscus'' (behind) in Norway: two species with clear differences.]]

A classic example of ring species is the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls circumpolar species &quot;ring&quot;. The range of these gulls forms a ring around the [[North Pole]].

The [[Herring Gull]] ''L. argentatus'', which lives primarily in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], can [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with the [[American Herring Gull]] ''L. smithsonianus'', (living in [[North America]]), which can also hybridize with the Vega or [[East Siberian Herring Gull]] ''L. vegae'', the western subspecies of which, [[Birula's Gull]] ''L. vegae birulai'', can hybridize with [[Heuglin's gull]] ''L. heuglini'', which in turn can hybridize with the Siberian [[Lesser Black-backed Gull]] ''L. fuscus''. All four of these live across the north of [[Siberia]]. The last is the eastern representative of the Lesser Black-backed Gulls back in north-western [[Europe]], including Great Britain.

The Lesser Black-backed Gulls and Herring Gulls are sufficiently different that they do not normally hybridize; thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except where the two lineages meet in Europe.

A recent genetic study has shown that this example is far more complicated than presented here (Liebers ''et al.'', 2004): This example only speaks to the complex of species from the classical Herring Gull through Lesser Black-backed Gull. There are several other taxonomically unclear examples which belong in the same [[superspecies]] complex, such as [[Yellow-legged Gull]] ''L. michahellis'', [[Glaucous Gull]] ''L. hyperboreus'' and [[Caspian Gull]] ''Larus cachinnans''.

==Other examples==

Other examples include:
* The ''[[Ensatina]]'' [[salamander]]s, which form a ring round the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] in [[California]]
* The [[Greenish Warbler]] (''Phylloscopus trochiloides''), around the [[Himalayas]] (Alström 2006)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[evolutionary biology]], the field of '''experimental evolution''' is concerned with testing [[hypotheses]] and [[evolution|theories of evolution]] by use of controlled [[experiment]]s. Evolution may be observed in the laboratory as populations adapt to new environmental conditions and/or change by such [[stochastic]] processes as random [[genetic drift]]. With modern [[molecular biology|molecular]] tools, it is possible to pinpoint the [[mutation]]s that [[selection]] acts upon, what brought about the [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s, and to find out how exactly these mutations work. Because of the large number of [[generation]]s required for adaptation to occur, evolution experiments are typically carried out with [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]] or [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name=Buckling&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buckling A, Craig Maclean R, Brockhurst MA, Colegrave N |title=The Beagle in a bottle |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=824–9 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19212400 |doi=10.1038/nature07892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elena SF, Lenski RE |title=Evolution experiments with microorganisms: the dynamics and genetic bases of adaptation |journal=Nat.

== Evolution experiments throughout human history ==
[[Image:IMG013biglittledogFX wb.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] show the wide range of dog breed sizes created using [[artificial selection]].]]
Unwittingly, humans have carried out evolution experiments for as long as they have been domesticating plants and animals. Selective breeding of plants and animals has led to varieties that differ dramatically from their original wild-type ancestors. Examples are the [[cabbage]] varieties, [[maize]], or the large number of different [[dog]] breeds. The power of human breeding to create varieties with extreme differences from a single species was already recognized by [[Charles Darwin]]. In fact, he started out his book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' with a chapter on variation in domestic animals. In this chapter, Darwin discussed in particular the pigeon. He wrote:
{{quotation|Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.

(...) I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (''Columba livia''), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects.|Charles Darwin|The Origin of Species}}

== Early experimental evolution ==
[[Image:Dallinger Incubator J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png|thumb|Drawing of the incubator used by Dallinger in his evolution experiments]]
One of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment was [[William Dallinger]]. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small [[unicellular organism]]s in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880-1886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60 °F up to 158 °F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73 °F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158 °F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158 °F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60 °F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Unfortunately, Dallinger's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.

== Modern experimental evolution ==
From the 1880s to 1980, experimental evolution was intermittently practiced by a variety of evolutionists, including the highly influential [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]].  Like other experimental research in evolutionary biology during this period, much of this work lacked extensive replication and was carried out only for relatively short periods of evolutionary time.

But by 1980, a variety of evolutionists realized that the key to successful experimentation lay in extensive parallel replication of evolving lineages as well as a larger number of generations of selection.  One of the first of a new wave of experiments using this strategy was the laboratory &quot;evolutionary radiation&quot; of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' populations that Michael R. Rose started in February, 1980.&lt;ref name='Rose1984a'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=M. R.|coauthors=|year=1984|title=Artificial selection on a fitness component in ''Drosophila melanogaster''| url=|journal=Evolution|issn=|volume=38|issue=|pages=516–526|doi=10.2307/2408701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system started with ten populations, five cultured at later ages, and five cultured at early ages.  Since then more than 200 different populations have been created in this laboratory radiation, with selection targeting multiple characters.  Some of these highly differentiated populations have also been selected &quot;backward&quot; or &quot;in reverse,&quot; by returning experimental populations to their ancestral culture regime.  Hundreds of people have worked with these populations over the better part of three decades.  Much of this work is summarized in the papers collected in the book ''Methuselah Flies'', listed below.

== Lenski's long-term evolution experiment with ''Escherichia coli'' ==
On [[February 15]], [[1988]], [[Richard Lenski]] started a [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term evolution experiment]] with the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]''. The experiment continues to this day, and is by now probably the largest controlled evolution experiment ever undertaken. Since the inception of the experiment, the bacteria have grown for more than 40,000 generations. Lenski and colleagues regularly publish [http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/ updates] on the status of the experiments.

== Garland's long-term experiment with laboratory house mice ==

In 1993, [[Theodore Garland, Jr.]] and colleagues started a long-term experiment that involves selective breeding for high voluntary activity levels on running wheels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/SwEA98SE.pdf Artificial Selection for Increased Wheel-Running Behavior in House Mice], John G. Swallow, Patrick A. Carter, and Theodore Garland, Jr, ''Behavior Genetics'', Vol. 28, No. 3, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  This experiment also continues to this day (&gt; 50 [[generations]]). Mice from the four replicate &quot;High Runner&quot; lines evolved to run 3 times as many running-wheel revolutions per day as compared with the four unselected Control mice groups, mainly by running faster rather than for the Control mice for more minutes/day.

The HR mice exhibit an elevated [[VO2max| maximal aerobic capacity]] when tested on a motorized treadmill and a variety of other traits that appear to be [[adaptations]] that facilitate high levels of sustained [[endurance]] running (e.g., larger [[heart]]s, more [[Symmetry (biology)|symmetrical]] hindlimb bones).  They also exhibit alterations in [[motivation]] and the [[reward system]] of the [[brain]].  [[Pharmacological]] studies point to alterations in [[dopamine]] function and the [[endocannabinoid system]].&lt;ref name='Keeneyetal2008'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keeney|first=B. K.|coauthors=D. A.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[biology]] the '''developmental systems theory''' (DST) is a collection of [[model]]s of [[biological]] development and [[evolution]] that argue that the emphasis the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] places on [[genes]] and [[natural selection]] as explanation of [[living]] [[structure]]s and [[processes]] is inadequate. Developmental systems theory embraces a range of positions, from the view that biological explanations need to include more elements than genes and natural selection, to the view that modern evolutionary theory profoundly misconceives the nature of living processes and should be rejected completely.

== Overview ==
All versions of developmental systems theory espouse the view that:

* All [[biological]] [[process]]es (including both evolution and development) operate by continually assembling new structures.

* Each such [[structure]] transcends the structures from which it arose and has its own systematic characteristics, information, functions and laws.

* Conversely, each such structure is ultimately [[irreducible]] to any lower (or higher) level of structure, and can be described and explained only on its own terms.

* Furthermore, the major processes through which [[life]] as a whole operates, including [[evolution]], heredity and the development of particular organisms, can only be accounted for by incorporating many more layers of structure and process than the conventional concepts of ‘[[gene]]’ and ‘[[Natural environment|environment]]’ normally allow for.

In other words, although it does not claim that all structures are equal, development systems theory is fundamentally opposed to [[reductionism]] of all kinds. In short, developmental systems theory intends to formulate a perspective which does not presume the causal (or [[ontological]]) priority of any particular entity and thereby maintains an explanatory openness on all empirical fronts.&lt;ref&gt; Moss in Oyama et al. 2001: 90.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is vigorous resistance to the widespread assumptions that one can legitimately speak of genes ‘for’ specific phenotypic characters or that adaptation consists of evolution ‘shaping’ the more or less passive species, as opposed to adaptation consisting of organisms actively selecting, defining, shaping and often creating their niches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewontin 2000&quot;&gt;Lewontin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Developmental systems theory: Topics ==
=== A computing metaphor ===
To adopt a computing metaphor, the reductionists whom developmental systems theory opposes assume that causal factors can be divided into ‘processes’ and ‘data’. Data (inputs, resources, content, and so on) is required by all processes, and must often fall within certain limits if the process in question is to have its ‘normal’ outcome. However, the data alone is helpless to create this outcome, while the process may be ‘satisfied’ with a considerable range of alternative data. Developmental systems theory, by contrast, assumes that the process/data distinction is at best misleading and at worst completely false, and that while it may be helpful for very specific pragmatic or theoretical reasons to treat a structure now as a process and now as a datum, there is always a risk (to which reductionists routinely succumb) that this methodological convenience will be promoted into an ontological conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Oyama’s discussion of the use and misuse of norms of reaction in Oyama et al. 2001: 179-184.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, for the proponents of DST, either all structures are both process and data, depending on context, or even more radically, no structure is either.

=== Fundamental asymmetry ===
For reductionists there is a fundamental asymmetry between different causal factors, whereas for DST such asymmetries can only be justified by specific purposes, and argue that many of the (generally unspoken) purposes to which such (generally exaggerated) asymmetries have been put are scientifically illegitimate. Thus, for developmental systems theory, many of the most widely applied, asymmetric and entirely legitimate distinctions biologists draw (between, say, genetic factors that create potential and environmental factors that select outcomes or genetic factors of determination and environmental factors of realisation) obtain their legitimacy from the conceptual clarity and specificity with which they are applied, not from their having tapped a profound and irreducible ontological truth about biological causation.&lt;ref&gt; Oyama in Oyama et al. 2001: 177-184.&lt;/ref&gt; One problem might be solved by reversing the direction of causation correctly identified in another. This parity of treatment is especially important when comparing the evolutionary and developmental explanations for one and the same character of an organism.

=== DST approach ===
One upshot of this approach is that developmental systems theory also argues that what is inherited from generation to generation is a good deal more than simply genes (or even the other items, such as the fertilised zygote, that are also sometimes conceded). As a result, much of the conceptual framework that justifies ‘selfish gene’ models is regarded by developmental systems theory as not merely weak but actually false. Not only are major elements of the environment built and inherited as materially as any gene but active modifications to the environment by the organism (for example, a termite mound or a beaver’s dam) demonstrably become major environmental factors to which future adaptation is addressed. This, once termites have begun to built their monumental nests, it is the demands of living in those very nests to which future generations of termite must adapt.

This inheritance may take many forms and operate on many scales, with a multiplicity of systems of inheritance complementing the genes. From position and maternal effects on gene expression to epigenetic inheritance &lt;ref&gt; Jablonka and Lamb 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; to the active construction and intergenerational transmission of enduring niches &lt;ref name=&quot;Lewontin 2000&quot;/&gt;, development systems theory argues that not only inheritance but evolution as a whole can be understood only by taking into account a far wider range of ‘reproducers’ or ‘inheritance systems’ – genetic, epigenetic, behavioural and symbolic &lt;ref&gt;Jablonka in Oyama et al. 2001 &lt;/ref&gt; – than neo-Darwinism’s ‘atomic’ genes and gene-like ‘replicators’ &lt;ref&gt; Dawkins 1976, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; DST regards every level of biological structure as susceptible to influence from all the structures by which they are surrounded, be it from above, below, or any other direction – a proposition that throws into question some of (popular and professional) biology’s most central and celebrated claims, not least the ‘central dogma’ of Mendelian genetics, any direct determination of phenotype by genotype, and the very notion that any aspect of biological (or psychological, or any other higher form) activity or experience is capable of direct or exhaustive genetic or evolutionary ‘explanation’.&lt;ref&gt; Oyama 1985; Oyama et al. 2001; Lewontin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental systems theory is plainly radically incompatible with both neo-Darwinism and information processing theory. Whereas neo-Darwinism defines¬ evolution in terms of changes in gene distribution, the possibility that an evolutionarily significant change may arise and be sustained without any directly corresponding change in gene frequencies is an elementary assumption of developmental systems theory, just as neo-Darwinism’s ‘explanation’ of phenomena in terms of reproductive fitness is regarded as fundamentally shallow. Even the widespread mechanistic equation of ‘gene’ with a specific DNA sequence has been thrown into question &lt;ref&gt;Neumann-Held 1999; Moss in Oyama et al. 2001: 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;, as have the analogous interpretations of evolution and adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levins and Lewontin 1985&quot;&gt;Levins and Lewontin 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Likewise, the wholly generic, functional and anti-developmental models offered by information processing theory are comprehensively challenged by DST’s evidence that nothing is explained without an explicit structural and developmental analysis on the appropriate levels. As a result, what qualifies as ‘information’ depends wholly on the content and context out of which that information arises, within which it is translated and to which it is applied.&lt;ref&gt; See Oyama 2000 for a detailed critique of information processing theory from a developmental systems perspective)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
Developmental systems theory is by no means a narrowly defined collection of ideas, and the boundaries with neighbouring models are very porous. Notable related ideas (with key texts) include:

* Baldwinian selection, or the [[Baldwin effect]] &lt;ref&gt; Baldwin 1895, 1896a, 1896b.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Vernadsky's and Teilhard's theories */ not independent</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Universal evolution''' is a theory of [[evolution]] formulated by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[Julian Huxley]] that describes the gradual development of the Universe from subatomic particles to human society, considered by Teilhard as the last stage. (see [[Gaia theory]]). 

==Vernadsky's and Teilhard's theories==
[[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] influenced [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and the two formulated very similar theories describing the gradual development of the Universe from subatomic particles to human society and beyond.  Teilhard's theories are better known in the West (and have also been commented on by [[Julian Huxley]]), and integrate [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] and [[Christianity]],  whilst Vernadsky wrote more purely from a scientific perspective, and his ideas contributed to [[Gaia theory]]. 

Three classic levels are described.  Cosmogenesis (Teilhard) or the formation of inanimate matter (the [[Physiosphere]] of [[Ken Wilber|Wilber]]), culminating in the [[Lithosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]], [[Hydrosphere]], etc (Teilhard), or collectively, the Geosphere (Vernadsky).  Here progress is ruled by structure and mechanical laws, and matter is primarily of the nature of non-consciousness (Teilhard - the &quot;Without&quot;).

This is followed by Biogenesis (Teilhard) and the origin of life or the  [[Biosphere]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard), where there is a greater degree of [[complexity]] and consciousness (Teilhard - the &quot;Within&quot;), [[ecology]] ((Vernadsky) comes into play, and progress and development is the result of Darwinian mechanisms of evolution.

Finally there is [[human evolution]] and the rise of thought or [[cognition]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard),  and a further leap in complexity and the interior life  or consciousness (Teilhard), resulting in the birth of the [[Noosphere]] (Vernadsky, Teilhard).  Just as the biosphere transformed the geosphere, so the noosphere (human intervention) transformed the biosphere (Vernadsky).  Here the evolution of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, economic, informational and communicative processes.

For Teilhard there is a further stage, one of [[spiritual evolution]], the Christing of the collective noosphere, in which humanity converges in a single divinisation he calls the [[Omega Point]].

==Evolutionary stages==

Nine levels are described, the &quot;classical&quot; biological stages being levels 6, 7 &amp; 8 of the universal evolution. Stages 1 to 5 are grouped into the [[Lithosphere]], also called [[Geosphere]] or [[Physiosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by structure, mechanical laws and coincidence. Stages 6 to 8 are grouped into the [[Biosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by genetical mechanisms. The actual stage, stage 9, is called the [[Noosphere]], where (the progress of) the structure of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, informational and communicative processes.

An '''anastomosis''' (plural '''anastomoses''', from gr. ἀναστόμωσις, ''communicating opening'') is a network of streams that both branch out and reconnect, such as blood vessels or leaf veins. The term is used in [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[mycology]] and [[geology]].

==Medicine==
Anastomosis is the connection of two structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Gylys, Barbara A. and Mary Ellen Wedding|title=Medical Terminology Systems|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to connections between [[blood vessel]]s or between other tubular structures such as loops of [[intestine]]. In [[circulatory anastomosis]], many arteries naturally anastomose with each other, for example the [[inferior epigastric artery]] and [[superior epigastric artery]].The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis(eg. palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis(eg. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). An example of [[surgical anastomosis]] occurs when a segment of intestine is resected and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed), for example [[Roux-en-Y anastomosis]]. The procedure is referred to as intestinal anastomosis.

[[Pathology|Pathological]] anastomosis results from trauma or disease and may involve [[vein]]s, [[artery|arteries]], or intestines. These are usually referred to as [[fistula]]s. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (enetero-enteric fistula) or intestine and [[skin]] (enterocutaneous fistula). [[Portacaval anastomosis]], by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the [[portal circulation]] and a vein of the [[systemic circulation]], which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with [[portal hypertension]], often resulting in [[hemorrhoids]], [[esophageal varices]], or [[caput medusae]].

==Biology==

===Evolution===
In [[evolution]], anastomosis is a recombination of evolutionary lineage. Conventional accounts of evolutionary lineage present themselves as the simple branching out of species into novel forms.  Under anastomosis, species might recombine after initial branching out, such as in the case of recent research which shows that ancestral populations along human and chimpanzee lineages may have interbred after an initial branching event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Patterson | first = Nick | coauthors = ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | month = May | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | pages = 1103–1108 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7097/abs/nature04789.html | accessdate = 2006-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of anastomosis also applies to the theory of [[symbiogenesis]], in which new [[species]] emerge from the formation of novel symbiotic relationships.

===Mycology===
In [[mycology]], anastomosis is the fusion between branches of the same or different [[hyphae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Kendrick, Bryce|title=The Fifth Kingdom|publisher=Mycologue Publications|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials in the form of dissolved [[ions]], [[hormones]], and [[nucleotides]], the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores, several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in [[pheromonal recognition]], fusing to form a genetic singular that can cover hectares called a [[genet]].

For fungi, anastomosis is also [[sex]]. In some fungi, two different [[haploid]] mating types — if compatible — merge. [[Somatically]], they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, is that in each [[septated]] unit is binucleate, containing two unfused [[nuclei]], i.e. one from each parent that do not undergo [[karyogamy]].

==Geology==
In [[geology]], anastomosis refers to quartz (or other) veins displaying this property, which is often related to shearing in metamorphic regions. 

There is also a type of stream or river called anastomosing, which consists of a wide strath and multiple [[thalweg|thalwegs]] divided by vegetated stabilized islands within subparallel banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionary ethics''' concerns approaches to [[ethics]] ([[morality]]) based on the role of [[evolution]] in shaping human [[psychology]] and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices. Alternatively and to a large extent separately, theories or ideas about evolution may be used to justify and advance particular ethical systems and particular morals (i.e. what is right and wrong). 

==Evolutionary psychology==

Evolutionary psychology attempts to explain major features of psychology in terms of species-wide evolved (via [[natural selection]]) predispositions. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, deceptive or harmful behaviors, an innate sense of fairness or unfairness, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, feelings related to competitiveness and moral punishment or [[Retributive justice|retribution]], moral &quot;cheating&quot; or [[hypocrisy]], and inclinations for a wide variety of actions judged morally good or bad by (at least some within) a given society. 

A historically key challenge to evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved when the process of [[natural selection]] is based on competition between different genes. Theories addressing this have included [[kin selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). [[Group selection]] theories have also, more controversially, been advanced.

==Analytic philosophy==
In 1986, [[Michael Ruse]] summarized the role of evolution as the source of ethical feelings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our moral sense, our altruistic nature, is an adaptation—a feature helping us in the struggle for existence and reproduction—no less than hands and eyes, teeth and feet. It is a cost-effective way of getting us to cooperate, which avoids both the pitfalls of blind action and the expense of a superbrain of pure rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ruse 1986, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In applying science to [[metaethics]], Ruse writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a sense … the evolutionist's case is that ethics is a collective illusion of the human race, fashioned and maintained by natural selection in order to promote individual reproduction. … ethics is illusory inasmuch as it persuades us that it has an objective reference. This is the crux of the biological position.&lt;ref&gt;Ruse 1986, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If ethics is just an illusion, that logically leads to [[amoralism]].

==History==
In his 1893 book ''Evolution and Ethics'', [[Thomas Huxley]] allows that ethical sentiments have evolved but denies that this provides a basis for morality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The propounders of what are called the &quot;ethics of evolution,&quot; when the &quot;evolution of ethics&quot; would usually better express the object of their speculations, adduce a number of more or less interesting facts and more or less sound arguments, in favour of the origin of the moral sentiments, in the same way as other natural phenomena, by a process of evolution. I have little doubt, for my part, that they are on the right track; but as the immoral sentiments have no less been evolved, there is, so far, as much natural sanction for the one as the other. The thief and the murderer follow nature just as much as the philanthropist. Cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man may have come about; but, in itself, it is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Huxley's criticism alluded to the [[is-ought problem]] developed earlier by [[David Hume]] and the related [[naturalistic fallacy]] developed later by [[G. E. Moore]].

==The Future==

Given the current state of knowledge, Huxley's statement with regards to &quot;why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil&quot; is still accurate with regards to individual human tastes and predispositions.  Yet research in the fields of evolutionary psychology and primatology is beginning to reveal, in the general case, what is good and bad for our species in order for it to thrive and, in turn, more likely be happy.  [[Evolutionary psychology]]'s primary focus is to derive, especially through the deep analysis of hunter-gatherer culture and primate models, what is the most accurate description of general human predispositions (i.e. our innate &quot;hard-wiring&quot;).  And as this understanding grows, it will become more and more feasible to redesign culture itself to be more &quot;user friendly&quot; to its human members. After all, in the ultimate sense, culture (like a computer) is a tool to serve its users.  Noted primatologist [[Frans De Waal]] asserts, &quot;In the words of Edward Wilson, biology holds us &quot;on a leash&quot; and will let us stray only so far from who we are.  We can design our life any way we want, but whether we will thrive depends on how well the life fits human predispositions&quot; &lt;ref&gt;De Waal 2005, 233&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2009}}

      <comment>/* Evolution of oxygen evolution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oxygen evolution''' is the process of generating molecular [[oxygen]] through [[chemical reaction]]. Mechanisms of oxygen evolution include the [[oxidation]] of [[water]] during oxygenic [[photosynthesis]], [[electrolysis]] of water into oxygen and [[hydrogen]], and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution from [[oxide]]s and [[oxoacid]]s.

==Oxygen evolution in nature==
Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is the fundamental process by which breathable oxygen is generated in earth's [[biosphere]]. The reaction is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of photosynthesis in [[cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s. It utilizes the energy of [[light]] to split a water molecule into its [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s for photosynthesis. Free oxygen is generated as a waste product of this reaction, and is released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].

===Biochemical reaction===
Photosynthetic oxygen evolution occurs via the light-dependent oxidation of water to molecular oxygen and can be written as the following simplified chemical reaction:

2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 4e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

The reaction requires the energy of four [[photon]]s. The electrons from the oxidized water molecules replace electrons in the P&lt;sub&gt;680&lt;/sub&gt; component of [[photosystem|photosystem II]] which have been removed into an [[electron transport chain]] via light-dependent [[excited state|excitation]] and [[resonance energy transfer]] onto [[plastoquinone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Raven&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. | coauthors = Ray F. Evert, Susan E. Eichhorn | title = Biology of Plants, 7th Edition | publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers | date = 2005 | location = New York | pages = 115–127  | isbn = 0-7167-1007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosytem II therefore has also been referred to as water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raval&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raval M, Biswal B, Biswal U |title=The mystery of oxygen evolution: analysis of structure and function of photosystem II, the water-plastoquinone oxido-reductase |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=267–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16170631| doi=10.1007/s11120-005-8163-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protons are released into the [[thylakoid lumen]], thus contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient is the driving force for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis via [[photophosphorylation]] and coupling the absorption of light energy and oxidation of water to the creation of chemical energy during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raven&quot;/&gt;

===Oxygen-evolving complex===
[[Image:Oxygen evolving complex.png|thumb|300px|Oxygen evolution by water oxidation during [[photosynthesis]]. The jagged lines represent four [[photon]]s oxidizing the central cluster of the [[oxygen evolving complex]] by exciting and removing four electrons through a cycle of ''S-states''.]]
Water oxidation is catalyzed by a [[manganese]]-containing [[cofactor]] contained in [[photosystem II]]  known as the [[oxygen evolving complex]] (OEC) or water-splitting complex. Manganese is an important [[cofactor]], and [[calcium]] and [[chloride]] are also required for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raven&quot;/&gt;

[[X-ray crystallography]] studies have recently provided detailed models of the structure of the oxygen-evolving complex and its manganese cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferreira K, Iverson T, Maghlaoui K, Barber J, Iwata S |title=Architecture of the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving center |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5665 |pages=1831–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14764885| doi=10.1126/science.1093087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on structural and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] experiments, oxygen evolution involves a core three-plus-one cluster of three manganese [[ion]]s and one calcium ion, with one additional manganese, which are oxidized via intermediate states called ''S-states''. The O-O bond of molecular oxygen is formed between manganese-ligated oxygen atoms at the most oxidized, or S4, state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robblee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robblee J, Cinco R, Yachandra V |title=X-ray spectroscopy-based structure of the Mn cluster and mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1503 |issue=1-2 |pages=7–23 |year=2001 |pmid=11115621 |doi=10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00217-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of oxygen evolution===
Oxygen production during [[photosynthesis]] evolved on earth around 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ananyev&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ananyev G, Zaltsman L, Vasko C, Dismukes G |title=The inorganic biochemistry of photosynthetic oxygen evolution/water oxidation |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=1503 |issue=1-2 |pages=52–68 |year=2001 |pmid=11115624 |doi=10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00215-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen was not only a waste product of this reaction, but was also toxic to many metabolic processes such as [[nitrogen fixation]]. Consequently, it was released into the atmosphere as a means of [[toxicity|detoxification]]. This contributed to the conversion of earth's atmosphere from [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] to its current [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] composition, triggering the [[Oxygen Catastrophe]] and the evolution of [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]] utilizing the oxygen that was released by photosynthetic organisms as part of the [[oxygen cycle]].

===History of discovery===
It wasn't until the end of the 18th century that [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered by accident the ability of plants to &quot;restore&quot; air that had been &quot;injured&quot; by the burning of a candle. He followed up on the experiment by showing that air &quot;restored&quot; by [[vegetation]] was ''&quot;not at all inconvenient to a [[mouse]].&quot;'' He was later awarded a medal for his discoveries that: ''&quot;...no vegetable grows in vain... but cleanses and purifies our atmosphere.&quot;'' Priestley's experiments were followed up by [[Jan Ingenhousz]], a Dutch physician, who showed that &quot;restoration&quot; of air only worked in the presence of light and green plant parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raven&quot;/&gt;

Ingenhousz suggested in 1796 that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]) is split during photosynthesis to release oxygen, while the [[carbon]] combined with water to form [[carbohydrate]]s. While this hypothesis was attractive and reasonable and thus widely accepted for a long time, it was later proven incorrect. Graduate student C.B. Van Niel at [[Stanford University]] found that [[purple sulfur bacteria]] reduce carbon to carbohydrates, but accumulate [[sulfur]] instead of releasing oxygen. He boldly proposed that in analogy to the sulfur bacteria forming elemental sulfur from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), plants would form oxygen from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In 1937, this hypothesis was corroborated by the discovery that plants are capable of producing oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This discovery was made by [[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robin Hill]], and subsequently the light-driven release of oxygen in the absence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was called the ''Hill reaction''. Our current knowledge of the mechanism of oxygen evolution during photosynthesis was further established in experiments tracing [[isotopes of oxygen]] from water to oxygen gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raven&quot;/&gt;

==Technological oxygen evolution==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hoffman voltameter.jpg|thumb|300px|Hoffman electrolysis apparatus used in electrolysis of water{{puic|Image:Hoffman voltameter.jpg|log=2008 April 26}}]] --&gt;
Oxygen evolution occurs as a byproduct of [[hydrogen production]] via [[electrolysis of water]]. While oxygen production is not the main focus of industrial applications of water electrolysis, it becomes essential for [[life support system]]s in situations that require the generation of oxygen for air revitalization. Human exploration of regions that lack breathable oxygen, such as the deep sea or outer space, requires means of reliably generating oxygen apart from earth's atmosphere. [[Submarine]]s and [[spacecraft]] utilize either an [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] mechanism (water or solid oxide electrolysis) or [[chemical oxygen generator]]s as part of their life support equipment.

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''evolutionary algorithm''' (EA) is a [[subset]] of [[evolutionary computation]], a generic population-based [[metaheuristic]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]. An EA uses some mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]]: [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and [[natural selection|selection]]. [[Candidate solution]]s to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[fitness function]] determines the environment within which the solutions &quot;live&quot; (see also [[cost function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators. ''Artificial evolution'' (AE) describes a process involving individual ''evolutionary algorithm''s; EAs are individual components that participate in an AE.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying [[fitness landscape]]; this generality is shown by successes in fields as diverse as [[engineering]], [[art]], [[biology]], [[economics]], [[marketing]], [[genetics]], [[operations research]], [[evolutionary robotics|robotics]], [[social sciences]], [[physics]], [[politics]] and [[chemistry]]{{Fact|date=September 2008}}.

Apart from their use as mathematical optimizers, evolutionary computation and algorithms have also been used as an experimental framework within which to validate theories about [[biological evolution]] and [[natural selection]], particularly through work in the field of [[artificial life]]. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modelling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of [[microevolution|microevolutionary processes]], however some computer simulations, such as ''[[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]]'' and ''[[Avida]]'', attempt to model [[macroevolution]]ary dynamics.

A possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear [[genotype-phenotype distinction]]. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as [[embryogenesis]] to become a mature phenotype. This indirect [[encoding]] is believed {{Fact|date=July 2008}} to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve {{Fact|date=July 2008}} the [[evolvability]] of the organism. Recent work in the field of [[artificial development|artificial embryogeny]], or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. 

==Implementation of biological processes==
Usually, an initial population of randomly generated candidate solutions comprise the first generation. The fitness function is applied to the candidate solutions and any subsequent offspring. Two main classes of fitness functions exist: one where the fitness function does not change, as in optimizing a fixed function or testing with a fixed set of test cases; and one where the fitness function is mutable, as in using [[niche differentiation]] or [[co-evolution|co-evolving]] the set of test cases.

In [[selection]], parents for the next generation are chosen with a bias towards higher fitness. The parents reproduce by copying with recombination and/or mutation. [[Genetic recombination|Recombination]] acts on the two selected parents (candidates) and results in one or two children (new candidates). [[Mutation]] acts on one candidate and results in a new candidate. These operators create the offspring (a set of new candidates). These new candidates compete with old candidates for their place in the next generation ([[survival of the fittest]]).

This process can be repeated until a candidate with sufficient quality (a solution) is found or a previously defined computational limit is reached.

==Evolutionary algorithm techniques==
Similar techniques differ in the implementation details and the nature of the particular applied problem.
*[[Genetic algorithm]] - This is the most popular type of EA. One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers (traditionally binary, although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved), by applying operators such as recombination and mutation (sometimes one, sometimes both).  This type of EA is often used in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems;
*[[Genetic programming]] - Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs, and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem.
*[[Evolutionary programming]] - Like genetic programming, only the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve;
*[[Evolution strategy]] - Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions, and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates;

==Related techniques==
*[[Differential evolution]] - Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for [[numerical optimization]] problems.
*[[Particle swarm optimization]] - Based on the ideas of animal flocking behaviour. Also primarily suited for [[numerical optimization]] problems.
*[[Ant colony optimization]] - Based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths. Primarily suited for [[combinatorial optimization]] problems.
*[[Invasive weed optimization algorithm]] - Based on the ideas of weed colony behavior in searching and finding a suitable place for growth and reproduction.
*[[Harmony search]] - Based on the ideas of musicians' behavior in searching for better harmonies. This algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization.
*[[Gaussian adaptation]] - Based on information theory. Used for maximization of manufacturing yield, [[mean fitness]] or [[average information]]. See for instance [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Noogenesis''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''noös''=mind + ''genos''=birth) is the fourth of five stages of [[Evolution (philosophy)|evolution]] described by French [[Jesuit]] scientist and philosopher, [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] in his first posthumously published book, ''The Phenomenon of Man'' (written during 1938–40, published in French: 1955; English: 1959, p. 181). Noogenesis, the emergence of [[mind]], follows [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|geogenesis]] (beginning of Earth), [[Origin of life|biogenesis]] (beginning of life) and [[human evolution|anthropogenesis]] (beginning of humanity), and is followed by [[Christ]]ogenesis, the genesis of the &quot;total Christ&quot;, or the [[pleroma]]. 

Noogenesis began with reflective thought; or with the first human beings. Teilhard believes that because human beings are self-reflective (i.e. self-conscious) they constitute a new sphere of existence on earth: the sphere of thought, or the [[noosphere]]. The continued consolidation of all human thought into the noosphere is noogenesis. It is a continual increase in thought and consciousness brought about by the increased socialization of mankind on earth. As human beings continue to socialize, or as Teilhard says, &quot;totalize&quot; upon themselves, the more complex systems of communication and exchange they will form, thus increasing the consciousness of the noosphere. The socialization of mankind is nothing but an extension of the [[Law of Complexity/Consciousness]]. 

Teilhard imagines that noogenesis will eventually reach a critical point of consciousness, brought about by a maximum tension of human socialization. This critical point will serve to detach consciousness from time and space and to converge on [[omega point]]. 

Noogenesis is a form of [[orthogenesis]], the progressive evolution of the universe due to some known or unknown force towards an ultimate goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Theistic evolution''' and '''evolutionary creationism''' are similar concepts that assert that classical religious teachings about [[God]]  are compatible with the modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. 
In short, theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is (in some way) [[Creator deity|the ''creator'']] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (''by consequence'') all life within, and that biological evolution is simply a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]].

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory|theory]] in the [[Science|scientific]] sense, but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]] &amp;mdash;that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. In describing early proponents of this viewpoint, it is sometimes described as ''[[Christian]] [[Darwinism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Creationists]]'' Expanded Edition, pp 34-38&lt;/ref&gt; A very similar view is ''evolutionary creationism''.&lt;ref name=EvC&gt;''Evolution Vs. Creationism'', [[Eugenie Scott]], Niles Eldredge, p62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term was used by [[National Center for Science Education]] executive director [[Eugenie Scott]] to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the theological view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching [[deism]] in rejecting continued intervention. Others see intervention at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of [[speciation]], but with similarities to the ideas of [[Progressive Creationism]] that God created &quot;kinds&quot; of animals sequentially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/1593_the_creationevolution_continu_12_7_2000.asp The Creation/Evolution Continuum] by [[Eugenie Scott]], December 2000, [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acceptance ==
This view is accepted (or at least not rejected) by major [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church and some [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations; some [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]].

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature. 
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms &quot;light&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, and &quot;morning&quot; hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSCF3-88Young.html&quot;&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, &quot;The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation&quot; from ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' 40.1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Three noted Jewish examples are that of the writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]] (1st century),&lt;ref name=&quot;book2.html&quot;&gt;{{wayback|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html|title=&quot;Allegorical Interpretation, I&quot; from ''The Works of Philo Judaeus'', translated by C.D. Yonge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] (12th century) and [[Gersonides]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' 2:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish_philosophy#Jewish_philosophy_after_Maimonides|Milchamot Hashem]]'' 6:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of &quot;creatia continua&quot; or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation. Changes such as these caused by science are part of a secondary causation that changes us within the framework of the world God has created with primary causation.{{Clarify me|post-text=(incoherent)|date=March 2009}}  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''evolutionary creationism'' refers to an understanding of God that transcends yet includes normal time and space, with nature having no existence independent of God. It allows interpretations consistent with both literal and poetic readings of Genesis and objective science.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

==Definition==
{{Rquote|right|....creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.|Fr [[George Coyne]], Director, Vatican Observatory, 1978-2006}}
Theistic evolution holds that the theist's acceptance of [[evolutionary biology]] is not fundamentally different from the acceptance of other [[science]]s, such as [[astronomy]] or [[meteorology]]. The latter two are also based on a [[methodology|methodological]] assumption of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] to study and explain the natural world, without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the [[supernatural]]. In this view, it is held both religiously and scientifically correct to reinterpret ancient religious texts in line with modern-day scientific findings about evolution.  St. Anselm described theology as &quot;Faith seeking understanding&quot;&lt;ref name=Anselm&gt;
{{cite book 
|title=Proslogion
|last=St Anselm
|authorlink=Anselm of Canterbury
|year=1077&amp;ndash;1078
|chapter=Preface
|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Proslogion}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and theistic evolutionists believe that this search for understanding extends to scientific understanding.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  In light of this view, authors writing on the subject, such as Ted Peters and Martinez Hewlett, say that &quot;The best science and our best thinking about God belong together.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt; Peters and Hewlett see science as a means of evaluating, understanding, and using to our benefit the intricacies of the world that God has created for us.

This synthesis of science with the [[teleology]] underlying [[faith]] and religious teachings can still be described as [[creationism]] in holding that divine intervention brought about the [[origin of life]] or that divine Laws govern formation of species, but in the [[creation-evolution controversy]] its proponents generally take the &quot;evolutionist&quot; side. For this reason, some on both sides prefer to use the term &quot;theistic evolution&quot; over &quot;evolutionary creationism&quot; to describe this belief.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==Spectrum of viewpoints==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.

===Christianity===
{{seealso|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Genesis]]; however, according to Roman [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] Churches, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSCF3-88Young.html&quot;/&gt; Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

====Contemporary Christian denominations====
Many [[Christian denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by &quot;[[Evolution Sunday]]&quot; where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] [[USA]] has issued a teaching resource to &quot;assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation.&quot; This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis &quot;should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

=====Anglicanism=====
Although [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible &quot;contains all things necessary to salvation,&quot; nonetheless &quot;science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding.&quot; Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, Anglicans view &quot;Big Bang cosmology&quot; as being &quot;in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation.&quot; Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19021_58398_ENG_HTM.htm Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that &quot;creationism is, in a sense, a kind of category mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

=====Church of the Nazarene=====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees &quot;knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation,&quot; and, while the church &quot;'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the &quot;how&quot; of creation.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ &quot;Can God Love Darwin, Too?&quot; by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Richard G. Colling]], author of ''Random Designer''&lt;ref&gt;''Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator'', Browning Press, 2004, ISBN 0975390406&lt;/ref&gt; and professor at [[Olivet Nazarene University]], received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ &quot;Can God Love Darwin, Too?&quot; by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darrel R. Falk]] of [[Point Loma Nazarene]] published a similar book in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, ISBN 0830827420&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Giberson]] of [[Eastern Nazarene]], the first Nazarene scholar to publish with [[Oxford University Press]], has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds Apart: The Unholy War between Religion and Science'', Beacon Hill Press, 1993 ISBN 0834115042&lt;br /&gt;With [[Donald Yerxa]], ''Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002 ISBN 0742507645&lt;br /&gt;With [[Mariano Artigas]], ''The Oracles of Science: Celebrity Scientist Versus God and Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2006 ISBN 0195310721&lt;/ref&gt; including his most recently published ''Saving Darwin''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ &quot;Can God Love Darwin, Too?&quot; by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include [[Thomas Jay Oord]] ([[Science of Love]], [[The Altruism Reader]]), Michael Lodahl [[God of Nature and of Grace]]), and Samuel M. Powell ([[Participating in God]]).  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: &quot;The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation (“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . .”—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf Manual, p.371]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eastern Orthodox Church=====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as [[compatibilism and incompatibilism]].

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

On the other hand, incompatibilists hold that science can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place.
Bufeev, S. V, is an incompatibilist&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=====Roman Catholic Church=====
{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}

The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis|monogenism]]) for the human race. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life. The Church's stance is that the temporal appearance of life has been guided by God, but the Church has thus far declined to define in what way that may be. 

The official Church's position remains a focus of controversy and is fairly non-specific, stating only that faith and the origin of man's material body &quot;from pre-existing living matter&quot; are not in conflict, and that the existence of God is required to explain the spiritual component of man's origin.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} 

Catholic schools do not teach theistic evolution as part of their science curriculum. They teach the [[evolution as theory and fact|facts of evolution]] and the [[Theory|scientific theory]] of its mechanisms. This is essentially the same biological curriculum taught in public schools and secular universities.

===Deism===
{{seealso|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments. Other deists take the stronger position that God ceased to exist after setting in motion the laws of the universe.

One recent convert to deism is philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], now argues that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argues that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] &quot;has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though he subsequently retracted this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: &quot;What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrel}}&lt;!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --&gt;

===Evolutionary creationism===
&lt;!--- Q: this needs clarification. is it a general spiritual/religious belief separate from the usual Judeo-Christian &amp; Islamic views? User:Rursus agrees: this needs clarification. It is in fact a creationist stance. ---&gt;
Evolutionary creationism[http://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/3EvoCr.htm], states that the Creator God uses evolution to bring about his plan. [[Eugenie Scott]] and Niles Eldredge state in ''Evolution Vs. Creationism'' that it is in fact a type of evolution, as well as that it is &quot;hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=EvC/&gt;

===Islam===
{{seealso|Islamic creationism}}
Some Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism, especially among the [[Liberal movements within Islam|Liberal movements]] within [[Islam]]. 

More literalist Muslims, including followers of [[Wahhabism]], reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that &quot;Allah is the Creator of everything&quot; (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to &quot;nature,&quot; because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
{{seealso|Ahmadiyya views of Evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement is perhaps the only denomination in Islam that actively promotes [[evolution]]ary theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html ITL: Jesus and the Indian Messiah - Every Wind of Doctrine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ahmadis interpret scripture from the Quran to support the concept of [[macroevolution]] and give precedence to scientific theories. Furthermore, unlike more orthodox muslims, Ahmadis believe that mankind has gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God - as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://textonly.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
Rather than wholly adopting the theory of [[natural selection]], Ahmadis promote the idea of a &quot;guided evolution&quot;, viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{seealso|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Creation according to Genesis|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbolism|symbolic]] work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods (justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned). In the latter view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

==Proponents==
===Evolutionary biologists who were also theists===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&amp;ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that &quot;the unseen universe of Spirit&quot; had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&amp;ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries. 

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&amp;ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&amp;ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:&quot;I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness.&quot;

The role of Scripture in relation to science is captured by an oft-quoted phrase: &quot;The Bible tell us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.&quot;  The phrase is especially heard in discussions of the relation between cosmology and theology.  In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps more appropriate: &quot;The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant.&quot;

==Criticism==
The major criticism of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential belief in a [[supernatural]] [[Creator deity|creator]]. These proponents claim that by the application of [[Occam's razor]], sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided for non-theistic evolutionists by the principle of ''natural'' selection, and the intervention or direction of a ''super''natural entity is not required. In the words of [[Richard Dawkins]], &quot;the illusion of design in the living world is explained with far greater economy … by Darwinian natural selection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R. ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (Transworld Publishers, 2006; ISBN 0-618-68000-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds, finding it hard to reconcile the nature of a loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the [[Fall of Man]]. They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of believing that it is a historical report. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call &quot;[[Atheism|atheistic]]&quot; [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] will confine God to the gaps in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] through Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i4/theistic_evolution.asp answersingenesis.org: ''10 dangers of theistic evolution'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to intelligent design==
{{Expand-section|date=March 2007}}
{{seealso|Intelligent design}}
Some adherents of theistic evolution hold that the deity both designed the universe and has a continuing part in its development, and feel that a term they favour has been hijacked by the proponents of the viewpoint called &quot;[[Intelligent design]]&quot;. One notable proponent of theistic evolution, [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] is a critic of [[Intelligent design]].

'''''Growing Up in the Universe''''' was a series of lectures given by [[Richard Dawkins]] as part of the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], in which he discussed the evolution of life in the universe.

The lectures were first broadcast in 1991, in the form of five one-hour episodes, on the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] was granted the rights to the televised lectures, and a DVD version was released by the foundation on [[April 20]], [[2007]].

==Parts==
===Part 1: Waking Up in the Universe===
To start off part one, Dawkins discusses the amazing capabilities of the [[human body]] and contrasts these with the limited capabilities of computers and other man-made machines. He uses a small [[totem pole]] (which is used in [[ancestor worship]]) to illustrate the importance of studying our ancestors in order to understand how we've evolved. To contrast ease of reproduction with the difficulty of becoming an ancestor, Dawkins uses the example of paper folding to explain [[exponential growth]]. Dawkins then tells the audience that exponential growth does not generally happen in the real world - natural factors come into play which control the population numbers, meaning that only an elite group of organisms will actually become distant ancestors. To be in this elite group, the organism must &quot;have what it takes&quot; to survive and pass on their genes to offspring.

The long chain of successful ancestors means that the probability of our existence is very small, and we are lucky to be alive. By turning down the lights and shining a small spotlight on a large ruler in front of him, Dawkins illustrates the darkness of the distant past and of the unknown future. 

After expounding on how lucky we are to be alive, and urging us not to waste the precious time that we have, Dawkins brings up the usefulness of science in aiding our understanding of the universe. He mentions the reply that [[Michael Faraday]] gave to [[Sir Robert Peel]] when asked about the use of science. Faraday's response was &quot;What is the use of a baby?&quot; Dawkins explains that Faraday was either referring to the vast potential of a baby, or to the idea that there must be something more to life than growing up, working, getting old, and dying. There must be a point to it all; Perhaps science can uncover the answers to our biggest questions. 
[[Image:Dawkins guitu.jpg|thumb|300px|Richard Dawkins delivering the first lecture, &quot;Waking Up in the Universe.&quot;]]

To shake off the &quot;anesthetic of familiarity,&quot; Dawkins shows the audience a number of strange terrestrial organisms which he humorously nicknames &quot;By-Jovians,&quot; playing off a term we might use to refer to living organisms from another planet, for instance Jupiter. He uses a [[scanning electron microscope]] to look at small organisms including mites, mosquitoes, and a bee being parasitized by a [[strepsiptera]]. Using a model of a [[eukaryotic]] cell, he discusses the [[mitochondria]] and presents the audience with a complicated diagram of the [[metabolic pathways]].

Dawkins suggests that we can also shake off the familiarity by stepping backwards in time. By using a single pace to represent going back 1000 years, he starts at year zero and takes four steps in front of his desk, going back to 4000 B.C.E. Pointing to a portrait of [[Homo habilis]], he states that to go back to the time of habilis, he would have to walk about two kilometers. He has audience members hold up portraits of other human ancestors, telling them how far he would have to walk to get back to the time of each one.

By imagining what an advanced alien species would think of humans if they were to arrive on Earth, Dawkins suggests that their science would be similar to ours. They would know about [[pi]], the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and the [[theory of relativity]]. However, Dawkins explains that the alien anthropologists would most likely scoff at our local, parochial religious beliefs. He then contrasts evidence-based beliefs with revealed, tradition-based, and authority-based beliefs. 

To explain the problem with beliefs in the supernatural, Dawkins conducts a small experiment with the audience in order to &quot;find the psychic.&quot; Using a coin, he assigns half the audience to will it to land on heads, and assigns the other half to will it to land on tails. After each flip, the section of the audience that was wrong is eliminated from the experiment, and he repeats the experiment using the remainder. After eight coin flips, only one boy in the audience remains. Dawkins then asks the question &quot;Is he psychic?&quot; Obviously, because of how the experiment was set up, one person was bound to have been correct about the result of each coin flip. Dawkins argues that this is exactly how seemingly supernatural events occur in the real world, especially when the &quot;audience&quot; is the entire population of the planet.

To conclude the lecture, Dawkins claims that there is nothing wrong with having faith in a proper scientific prediction. To illustrate this, he takes a cannonball which has been suspended from the ceiling with a rope, pulls it aside and touches it to his forehead. He announces that he is going to release the cannonball, letting it swing away from him, and that when it comes back to him, he is going to ignore his natural instinct to run because he has faith in his scientific prediction of what will happen - the cannonball should stop about an inch short of his forehead. He releases the cannonball, and his prediction is proved correct.

===Part 2: Designed and Designoid Objects===
Dawkins' second lecture of the series examines the problem of design. He presents the audience with a number of simple objects, such as [[rocks]] and [[crystals]], and notes that these objects have been formed by simple laws of physics and are therefore not designed. He then examines some designed objects - including a [[microscope]], an electronic [[calculator]], a [[pocket watch]], 
and a clay pot - and notes that none of these objects could have possibly come about by sheer luck. Dawkins then discusses what he calls &quot;designoid objects&quot;, which are complex objects that are neither simple, nor designed. Not only are they complex on the outside, they are also complex on the inside - perhaps billions of times more complex than a designed object such as a microscope.

Dawkins then shows the audience a number of designed and designoid objects, including the [[pitcher plant]], megalithic mounds built by the compass termite, and pots made by [[trapdoor spider]]s, [[potter wasp]]s, and [[mason bee]]s. He examines some designoid objects that use [[camouflage]], such as a [[grasshopper]] that looks like a stone, a [[sea horse]] that looks like sea weed, a [[leaf insect]], a green snake, a [[stick insect]], and a collection of [[butterflies]] that look like dead leaves when their wings are closed. Dawkins notes that many animals share similar types of camouflage or protection because of a process called [[convergent evolution]]. Examples of such designoid objects include the [[hedgehog]] and the [[spiny anteater]] (both of which evolved pointed spines along their back) and the [[marsupial wolf]] (which looks like a dog but is actually a marsupial). He illustrates the reason why convergent evolution occurs by using two small models of commercial aircraft. The reason they look similar isn't due to industrial espionage, it is due to the fact that they are both built in order to fly, so they must make use of similar design principles.

Using a camera and a model eye, Dawkins then compares the designed camera with the designoid eye. Both are involved in similar processes - using a lens to direct light onto a film or a retina. Both the camera and the eye also have an iris, which is used to control the amount of light which is allowed in. Using a volunteer from the audience, Dawkins demonstrates the contraction of the human 
iris by shining a light into her right eye. 

The lecture then moves into an explanation of [[natural selection]], which brings forth designoid objects. In order to explain natural selection, Dawkins first explains [[artificial selection]] by discussing the evolution of [[wild cabbage]] into [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[cabbage]], [[red cabbage]], [[kohlrabi]], and [[Brussels sprouts]]. He continues the discussion of artificial selection by explaining the evolution of the ancestral wolf into the many varieties of modern dog. Starting with the ancestral wolf, Dawkins imagines that everyone on one side of the room is breeding for small wolves, while everyone on the other side is breeding for big wolves. By selectively breeding the smallest or largest of each litter for a number of years, you may eventually end up with something like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] on one side of the room, and something like a [[Great Dane]] on the other side of the room. 

Dawkins then introduces an Arthromorphs computer program (similar to the Biomorphs program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/mirror/biomorph/ Blind Watchmaker Applet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), explaining how it works while a volunteer uses the computer to selectively breed more and more generations.

At this point, Dawkins switches from explaining artificial selection to explaining natural selection. In order to demonstrate natural selection in a computer program, Dawkins uses a program written by Peter Fuchs to simulate the evolution of the [[spiderweb]]. The program builds &quot;genetic&quot; variations of a parent web, as if the web was actually being built by a child spider. For each generation, a simulation is run which randomly generates flies - some of which will hit the web, and others that will miss it. The child web that is able to capture the highest number of flies is selected as the parent for the next generation of webs. Dawkins shows the audience the &quot;fossil record&quot; that the program recorded after simulating a large number of generations overnight. The web starts off very simple and inefficient, but by the end it has evolved into a web that is highly efficient and highly complex. This is the same process that has led to the existence of all designoid objects.

Dawkins now discusses the most popular alternative to natural selection, which is known as [[creationism]]. He explains that creationists mistakenly believe designoid objects to be designed objects created by a divine being. Quoting from [[William Paley]]'s ''Natural Theology'', Dawkins discusses the [[argument from design]] using the example of the watch and the watchmaker. Even though designoid objects appear to be designed, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] proved that this is not the case. Although Darwin's theory was discovered well after Paley developed his watchmaker argument, Dawkins explains that the argument of a divine watchmaker was still a bad argument, even in Paley's day. Paraphrasing [[David Hume]], Dawkins explains that anything capable of creating humans must itself be highly complicated. Thus, the argument from design actually explains nothing - &quot;shooting itself in the foot.&quot; While it is true that designoid objects cannot come about by chance, evolution provides a non-random method of creation - namely, natural selection. 

After developing the argument against a divine creator, Dawkins examines a number of designoid objects that contain imperfections, which is something you would not expect to find in an object that is supposedly created by a divine being. Showing the audience a [[halibut]] flatfish, he explains how they evolved from an upright swimming ancestor with one eye on each side of the head into a bottom-hugging flatfish with a distorted set of eyes on one side of the body. Dawkins claims that this is poorly designed, as any proper engineer would design an organism more like a [[skate]], which flattened out on its belly instead of on its side. This is an example of something you would expect from an evolved/designoid object, but not something you would expect from a created/designed object. 

Using labeled building blocks, Dawkins shows the audience how designed objects came to be. He starts off by placing the simple block on the bottom, and explaining that you don't have to start with a complex being, but can start with a very simple foundation. If you have a simple foundation, you can place the next block on top - the designoid block. From this block, you can get complex organisms. Only after complex designoid objects come to be can you get the final building block of design (microscopes, clay pots, etc).

===Part 4: The Ultraviolet Garden===
{{Expand|date=October 2007}}
Dawkins begins by relating the story of asking a little girl &quot;what she thought flowers were 'for'.&quot; Her response is anthropocentric, that flowers are there for our benefit. Dawkins points out that many people throughout history have thought that the natural world existed for our benefit, with examples from Genesis and other literature. Author [[Douglas Adams]], who is sitting in the audience, is called to read a relevant passage from his novel ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''.

Dawkins then asks  his audience to put off the idea that the natural world exists for our benefit. He considers the question of flowers seen through the eyes of bees and other pollinators, and performs a series of demonstrations which use ultraviolet light to excite fluorescence in various substances.

==Quotations==
{{cquote|Life makes the wonders of technology seem commonplace. So where does life come from? What is it? Why are we here? What are we for? What is the meaning of life? There's a conventional wisdom which says that science has nothing to say about such questions. Well, all I can say is that if science has nothing to say, it's certain that no other discipline can say anything at all. But in fact, science has a great deal to say about such questions. And that's what these five lectures are going to be about. Life &quot;grows up&quot; in the universe by gradual degrees - evolution - and we grow up in our understanding of our origins and our meaning.}}

{{cquote|The present century is a tiny spotlight, inching its way along a gigantic ruler of time. Everything before the spotlight is the darkness of the dead past. Everything after the spotlight is in the darkness of the unknown future. We live in the spotlight. Of all the 200,000,000 centuries along the ruler of time, 199,999,999 centuries are in darkness. Only one is lit up, and that is the one in which we happen - by sheer luck - to be alive. The odds against our century happening to be the present century are the same as the odds against a penny tossed out at random on the road from London to Istanbul happening to fall on a particular ant.}}

{{cquote|We do of course, have an ordinary life to get on with. We do have a living to earn. We've got to earn our living being a solicitor or a lavatory cleaner or something like that. But nevertheless, it is worthwhile also from time to time shaking off the anaesthetic of familiarity and awakening to the wonder that is really all around us all the time.}}

{{cquote|Natural selection - nature - is constantly choosing which individual shall live, [and] which individual shall breed. And the result, after many generations of natural selection, is much the same as the result after many generations of artificial selection.}}

{{cquote|In any case, all creation, all design, all machines and houses and paintings and computers and airplanes, everything designed and made by us, everything made by other creatures, is only made possible because there are already brains put together as designoid objects - and designoid objects come about only through gradual evolution. Creation, when it does occur in the universe, is an afterthought. When creation appeared on this planet it came locally, and it came late. Creation does not belong in any account of the fundamentals of the universe. Creation is something that, rather late in the day, grows up in the universe.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:HCWatson.jpg|thumb|right|169px|'''Hewett Cottrell Watson''' (around 1830)]]
'''Hewett Cottrell Watson''' (1804-81) was a botanist, plant ecologist and evolutionist. He was born in [[Firbeck]], near [[Rotherham]], [[Yorkshire]], on 9 May 1804, and died at [[Thames Ditton]], [[Surrey]], on 27 July 1881.

He was the son of Holland Watson and Harriett (née Powell). He studied [[phrenology]] and natural history at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1828 to 1832. He inherited a place in [[Derbyshire]] around 1836. He moved to [[Thames Ditton]] in 1853 and visited the [[Azores]] in 1842. 

In 1852, Watson pioneered the study of the distribution of plants by dividing the whole of Great Britain into 112 areas, based on the then-county boundaries. These boundaries are unchanging and are unaffected by subsequent political and administrative changes. Watson's [[Vice Counties]] have been widely adopted by biologists. These fixed boundaries allow modern biologists to compare past records of species. 

He edited the ''Phrenological Journal'' from 1837 to 1840 and the ''London Catalogue of British Plants'' from 1844 to 1874.

Watson led a fairly unremarkable life -- he only travelled once outside of Britain -- yet became regarded in early life as an authority on English botany after cultivating strong interests in phrenology and evolutionary theory. 

Wealthy enough after an inheritance to not need a profession, he became involved with phrenology circa 1825 that only ended in 1840 when he failed as owner and editor to make the ''Phrenological Journal'' a success. In the following years, and while his reputation as a botanist steadily grew, he began collecting evidence for, and defending, the idea of species transmutation; later [[Charles Darwin]] acknowledged his debt to Watson as a source. 

Watson's many writings on plant geography included a considerable number of innovations; for example, he organised incidence data by county-level aggregations, related environmental circumstances to distribution patterns, differentiated between natural and anthropogenic origins, and made effective use of the concepts of ''station'' and ''habitat''.

''Eleocharis watsoni Bab'' ('Slender Spike-rush' -- now known as ''Eleocharis uniglumis Schultes'') was named after him.

His manuscripts are housed at the [[Natural History Museum]] and also at [[Kew]].
== Publications ==
His many published contributions include: 
* ''Outlines of distribution of British Plants'' (1832) 
* ''New Botany Guide'' (1835-7)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The issue of what exactly defines a '''vacant [[ecological niche|niche]]''' and whether they exist in [[ecosystems]] is controversial. The subject is intimately tied into a much broader debate on whether ecosystems can reach equilibrium, where they could theoretically become maximally saturated with species. Given that saturation is a measure of the number of species per resource axis per ecosystem, the question becomes: is it useful to define unused resource clusters as niche 'vacancies' or not?

==History of the concept==
[[Image:Brushtail possum.jpg|right|thumb|[[Introduced species]], such as the [[Common Brushtail Possum]], are often free of many of their normal parasites.]]
Whether vacant niches are permissible has been both confirmed and denied as the definition of a niche has changed over time. Within the pre-Hutchinsonian niche frameworks of Grinnell (1917)&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell, J. (1917). The niche relationship of the California Thrasher. Auk, 34, 427-433.&lt;/ref&gt; and Elton (1927)&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C. (1927). Animal Ecology. Sidgwick and Jackson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; vacant niches were allowable. In the framework of Grinnell, the species niche was largely equivalent to its [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], such that a niche vacancy could be looked upon as a habitat vacancy. The Eltonian framework considered the niche to be equivalent to a species position in a [[food web|trophic web]], or food chain, and in this respect there is always going to be a vacant niche at the top predator level. Whether this position gets filled depends upon the ecological efficiency of the species filling it however. 
  
The Hutchinsonian niche framework, on the other hand, directly precludes the possibility of there being vacant niches. Hutchinson defined the niche as an n-dimensional hyper-volume whose dimensions correspond to resource gradients over which species are distributed in a unimodal fashion. In this we see that the operational definition of his niche rests on the fact that a species is needed in order to rationally ''define'' a niche in the first place. This fact didn't stop Hutchinson from making statements inconsistent with this such as: “The question raised by cases like this is whether the three ''Nilghiri Corixinae'' fill all the available niches...or whether there are really empty niches.. . .The rapid spread of introduced species often gives evidence of empty niches, but such rapid spread in many instances has taken place in disturbed areas.” Hutchinson (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E. (1957). Concluding remarks. Cold Spring Harbour Symposium on Quantitative Biology 22, 415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of the “vacant” or “empty niche” has been used regularly in the scientific literature. Some of the many examples are Elton (1958, pp.135-136),&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C.S. 1958. The ecology of invasions by animals and plants. Chapman and Hall, London, UK. 181 pp. ).&lt;/ref&gt; Rohde (1977, 1979, 1980)&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1977). A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches. Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1979). A critical evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic factord responsible for restricting niches. American Naturalist 114, 648-671. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1980 ). Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt? Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?.  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102. ,&lt;/ref&gt; Lawton (1984),&lt;ref name=&quot;Non-competitive populations)&quot;, &gt;Lawton, J.H. (1984).

Ecoscience 6, 303-315. &lt;/ref&gt; Further examples, some of them in great detail, are discussed in Rohde (2005b).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

Despite the large scale currency that the term has gained as a &quot;catch all&quot; in scientific literature, surprisingly little effort has been made to come up with a coherent definition. 
The ecologist K. Rohde has suggested that a vacant niche can be defined as the possibility that in ecosystems or habitats  more species could exist than are present at a particular point in time, because many possibilities are not used by potentially existing species (Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt;
The ecologist M. A. Woodley has suggested that the concept of a niche vacancy may not be wholly incompatible with Hutchinson's species centered definition for niche, and that while Hutchinson relies upon the presence of a species along a specific resource gradient to define a niche, the specific ''absence'' of a species along a portion of a resource gradient could similarly be used to define a vacancy (Woodley and Sikes, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Woodley, M. A and Sikes, K. J. (2006). Consequences of geometry for species adaptation. Geombinatorics 16:2, 270-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential causes of vacant niches ==

Vacant niches could potentially have several causes. 

• Radical disturbances in a habitat: For example, droughts or forest fires can destroy a flora and fauna partially or completely. However, in such cases species suitable for the habitat usually survive in the neighbourhood and colonize the vacated niches, leading to a relatively fast re-establishment of the original conditions.

• Radical and long-lasting changes in the environment: such as ice ages.

• Evolutionary contingencies: suitable species did not evolve for usually unknown reasons, or pre-existing species which happened to have overlapping niches adaptively 'retreated' away from one another and in doing so created a niche vacancy.

==Demonstration of vacant niches==
[[Image:Adelaarsvaren planten Pteridium aquilinum.jpg |right|thumb|Studies of ''Pteridium aquilinum'' provide evidence of vacant niches.]]
Vacant niches can best be demonstrated by  considering the spatial component of niches in simple habitats. For example, Lawton and collaborators compared the insect fauna of the bracken ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'', a widely distributed species, in different habitats and geographical regions and found vastly differing numbers of insect species. They concluded that many niches remain vacant (e.g., Lawton 1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;Non- competitive populations)&quot; &gt;Lawton, J.H. (1984). Non-competitive populations, non-convergent communities, and vacant niches: the herbivores of bracken. In: Strong, D.R. Jr., Simberloff, D., Abele, L.G. and Thistle, A.B. eds. Ecological communities: conceptual issues and the evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., pp. 67-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohde and collaborators have shown that the number of ectoparasitic species on the gills of different species of marine fishes varies from 0 to about 30, even when fish of similar size and from similar habitats are compared. Assuming that the host species with the largest number of [[parasite]] species has the largest possible number of parasite species, only about 16% of all niches are occupied. However, the maximum may well be greater, since the possibility cannot be excluded that even on fish with a rich parasite fauna, more species could be accommodated (recent review in Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; Using similar reasoning, Walker and Valentine (1984)&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T.D. und Valentine, J.W.(1984). Equilibrium models of evolutionary diversity and the number of empty niches. American Naturalist 124, 887-899. &lt;/ref&gt; estimated that 12-54% of niches for marine invertebrates are empty. 

The ground breaking theoretical investigations of Kauffman (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. (1993). The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford. &lt;/ref&gt; and Wolfram (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, S. (2002).  A new kind of science.  Wolfram Media Inc. Champaign, Il. &lt;/ref&gt; also suggest the existence of a vast number of vacant niches. Using different approaches, both have shown that species rarely if ever reach global adaptive optima. Rather, they get trapped in local optima from which they cannot escape, i.e., they are not perfectly adapted. As the number of potential local optima is almost infinite, the niche space is largely unsaturated and species have little opportunity for interspecific competition. Kauffman (p.19) writes: “...many conceivable useful phenotypes do not exist”  and: (p.218) “[[Fitness landscape|Landscapes]] are rugged and multipeaked. Adaptive processes typically become trapped on such optima”.

The packing rules of Ritchie and Olff (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, M. and Olff, H. (1999). Spatial scaling laws yield a synthetic theory of biodiversity.  Nature 400, 557-562. &lt;/ref&gt; can be used as a measure of the filling of niche space. They apply to savanna plants and large herbivorous mammals, but not to all the parasite species examined so far. It seems likely that they do not apply to most animal groups. In other words, most species are not densely packed: many niches remain empty (Rohde 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (2001). Spatial scaling laws may not apply to most animal species. Oikos 93, 499-503. &lt;/ref&gt;

That niche space may not be saturated is also shown by introduced pest species. Such species lose, almost without exception, all or many of their parasites (Torchin and Kuris 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Torchin, M.E. and Kuris, A.M. (2005). Introduced parasites. In: Rohde, K. (Ed.) Marine Parasitology. CSIRO Publishing Melbourne und CABI Wallingford, Oxon., pp. 358-366. &lt;/ref&gt; Species that could occupy the vacant niches either do not exist or, if they exist, cannot adapt to these niches.

The diversity of marine [[benthos]], i.e. the organisms living near the seabed, though interrupted by some collapses and plateaus has increased from the [[Cambrian]] to the [[Recent]]. Furthermore there is no evidence to suggest that saturation has been reached (Jablonski 1999).&lt;ref&gt;D.Jablonski: The future of the fossil record, Science 284, 2114-2116, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of the nonsaturation of niche space==

The view that niche space is largely or completely saturated with species is widespread. It is thought that new species are accommodated mainly by subdivision of niches occupied by previously existing species, although an increase in diversity by colonization of large empty living spaces (such as land in the geologic past) or by the formation of new [[baupläne]] also occurs. It is also recognized that many populations never completely reach a climax state (i.e., they may come close to an equilibrium but never quite reach it). However, altogether the view prevails that individuals and species are densely packed and that interspecific competition is of paramount significance. According to this view, nonequilibria are generally caused by environmental disturbances.

However, many recent studies (above and Rohde 2005a,b)&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (2005a)  Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426. &lt;/ref&gt; support the view that niche space is largely unsaturated, i.e. that numerous vacant niches exist. As a consequence, competition between species is not as important as usually assumed. Nonequilibria are caused not only by environmental disturbances, but are widespread because of nonsaturation of niche space. Newly evolved species are absorbed into empty niche space, that is, niches occupied by existing species do not necessarily have to shrink.

==Relative frequency of vacant niches in various groups of animals and plants==

Available evidence suggests that vacant niches are more common in some groups than in others. Using [[SES values]] (standardized effect sizes) for various groups, which can be used as approximate predictors of the filling of niche space, Gotelli and Rohde (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, N.J. and Rohde, K. (2002). Co-occurrence of ectoparasites of marine fishes: null-model analysis. Ecology Letters 5, 86-94. &lt;/ref&gt;
have shown that SES values are high for large and vagile species or for those which occur in large population densities, and that they are low for animal species which occur in small population densities and/or are of small body size and have little vagility. In other words, more vacant niches can be expected for the latter.

==Criticisms of the concept==

The concept of vacant niche is not accepted by all. The reason given is that a niche is a property of a species; therefore a niche does not exist if no species is present. In other words, the term is thought to be “illogical”. However, some authors who have contributed most to the formulation of the modern niche concept (Hutchinson, Elton) apparently saw no difficulties in using the term. If a niche is defined as the interrelationship of a species with all the biotic and abiotic factors affecting it, there is no reason not to admit the possibility of additional potential interrelationships. So, it seems logical to refer to vacant niches. (see also [[ecological niche]].)

Furthermore, it seems that authors most critical of the concept &quot;vacant niche&quot; really are critical of the view that niche space is largely empty and can easily absorb additional species. They instead adhere to the view that communities are usually in equilibrium (or at least close to it), resulting in a continual strong competition for resources. But many recent studies, some empirical, some theoretical, have provided support for the alternate view that nonequilibrium conditions are widespread (see above and the recent review in Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)&quot;&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German literature, an alternate term for vacant niches has found some acceptance. It is that of “freie ökologische Lizens” (free ecological license) (Sudhaus und Rehfeld 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Sudhaus, W. und Rehfeld, K. Einführung in die Phylogenetik und Systematik.  Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena. &lt;/ref&gt; Also, M. A. Woodley has suggested that vacant niches should perhaps be referred to as ''negative species'', as in some frameworks they can be regarded as the inverse of the Hutchinsonian niche which takes the presence and distributions of a species as its definition (Woodley 2006). &lt;ref&gt; Woodley, M. A. (2006). The Limits of Ecology: New Perspectives from a Theoretical Borderland. Abramis Academic, Bury St. Edmunds, UK. &lt;/ref&gt; These have the disadvantage that they do not convey immediately and easily what is meant, and they do not correspond exactly to the term vacant niche. The usefulness of a term should be assessed on the basis of its understandability and on how fertile it is in promoting future research. The term vacant niche appears to fulfill these requirements.

The '''evolution of complexity''' is an important outcome of the process of [[evolution]]. Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms - although the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure accurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of [[cell type]]s or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] all being used to assess an organism's complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adami C |title=What is complexity? |journal=Bioessays |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1085&amp;ndash;94 |year=2002 |pmid=12447974 |doi=10.1002/bies.10192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waldrop M. ''et al.'' |title=Language: Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–1028 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/4551023a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation that complex organisms can be produced from simpler ones has led to the common misperception of evolution being progressive and having a direction that leads towards what are viewed as &quot;higher organisms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea D |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303&amp;ndash;324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, this idea of &quot;progression&quot; in evolution is regarded as misleading, with [[natural selection]] having no intrinsic direction and organisms selected for either increased or decreased complexity in response to local environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayala&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala FJ |title=Darwin's greatest discovery: design without designer |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=8567–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17494753 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/suppl_1/8567 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701072104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in the maximum level of complexity over the [[history of life]], there has always been a large majority of small and simple organisms and the most common level of complexity (the [[mode (statistics)|mode]]) has remained constant.

==Selection for simplicity and complexity==

Organisms that reproduce more quickly and plentifully than their competitors have an evolutionary advantage.  Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as [[malaria]] and [[mycoplasma]]; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sirand-Pugnet P, Lartigue C, Marenda M, ''et al.'' |title=Being Pathogenic, Plastic, and Sexual while Living with a Nearly Minimal Bacterial Genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e75 |year=2007 |pmid=17511520 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030075}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment. Loss of this trait need not necessarily confer a selective advantage, but may be lost by [[genetic drift]] if its loss does not confer an immediate selective disadvantage. For example, a parasitic organism may dispense with the synthetic pathway of a metabolite where it can readily scavenge that metabolite from its host. Discarding this synthesis may not necessarily allow the parasite to conserve significant energy or resources and grow faster, but may be fixed in the population through [[genetic drift]] if no disadvantage is incurred by loss of that pathway.

However, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens, with each side developing ever more sophisticated adaptations, such as the [[immune system]] and the many techniques pathogens have developed to evade it. For example, the parasite ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', which causes [[sleeping sickness]], has evolved so many copies of its major surface [[antigen]] that about 10% of its genome is devoted to different versions of this one gene. This tremendous complexity allows the parasite to constantly change its surface and thus evade the immune system through [[antigenic variation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pays E |title=Regulation of antigen gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=517–20 |year=2005 |pmid=16126458 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the [[co-evolution]] between an organism and the [[ecosystem]] of [[predator]]s, [[prey]] and [[parasite]]s to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the  others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an on-going [[evolutionary arms race]]  towards more complexity &lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen, F.]] (1999a) [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BQWrppy8ooIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Heylighen%22+%22The+growth+of+structural+and+functional+complexity+...%22+&amp;ots=p2cUiyexLo&amp;sig=T6Dk_PTHRocBj8Lou81w_mHtJZA &quot;The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution]&quot;, in F. Heylighen, J. Bollen &amp; A. Riegler (eds.) The Evolution of Complexity Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, 17-44.&lt;/ref&gt;. This trend may be reinforced by the fact that ecosystems themselves tend to become more complex over time, as [[species diversity]] increases, together with the linkages or dependencies between species.

==Types of trends in complexity==
[[Image:Evolution of complexity.svg|thumb|right|300px|Passive versus active trends in the evolution of complexity. Organisms at the beginning of the processes are colored red. Numbers of organisms are shown by the height of the bars, with the graphs moving up in a time series.]]

If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity, then we would expect to see an increase over time in the [[mode (statistics)|most common value]] (the mode) of complexity among organisms, as shown to the right.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102&amp;ndash;9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some [[artificial life|computer models]] have suggested that the generation of complex organisms is an inescapable feature of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Furusawa C, Kaneko K |title=Origin of complexity in multicellular organisms |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=84 |issue=26 Pt 1 |pages=6130&amp;ndash;3 |year=2000 |pmid=10991141 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.6130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adami C, Ofria C, Collier TC |title=Evolution of biological complexity |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/9/4463 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=4463&amp;ndash;8 |year=2000 |pmid=10781045 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4463}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as evolutionary [[self-organization]]. Self-organization is the spontaneous internal organization of a system. This process is accompanied by an increase in systemic complexity, resulting in an emergent property that is distinctly different from any of the constituent parts.

However, the idea of increasing production of complexity in evolution can also be explained through a passive process.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; As shown on the left, this involves an increase in [[variance]] but the mode does not change. Thus, the maximum level of complexity increases over time, but only as an indirect product of there being more organisms in total. 

In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly-complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model emphasises that the overwhelming majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oren A |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1693353&amp;blobtype=pdf |journal=Philos.

==History==

In the 19th century, some scientists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ray Lankester]] believed that all Nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution.  This belief may reflect then-current ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] that all creation was gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state.  

According to this view, the evolution of parasites from an independent organism to parasite was seen as &quot;[[Devolution (biological fallacy)|devolution]]&quot; or &quot;degeneration&quot;, and contrary to Nature.  This view has sometimes been used metaphorically by social theorists and propagandists to decry a class of people as &quot;degenerate parasites&quot;.  Today, &quot;devolution&quot; is regarded as nonsense; rather, lineages will become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms have a selective advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/askexpert_question.cfm?articleID=00071863-683B-1C72-9EB7809EC588F2D7 Scientific American; Biology: Is the human race evolving or devolving?] retrieved [[2007-06-11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, whether melanin-containing fungi employ a similar multi-step pathway as photosynthesis, or some [[chemosynthesis]] pathways, is unknown. 

Research at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] showed that three melanin-containing fungi, ''[[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]]'', ''[[Wangiella dermatitidis]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', increased in [[biomass]] and accumulated [[acetate]] faster in an environment in which the [[radiation]] level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment. Exposure of ''C. neoformans'' [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to these radiation levels rapidly (within 20-40 minutes of exposure) altered the chemical properties of its melanin and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer (measured as reduction of [[ferricyanide]] by [[NADH]]) 3 to 4-fold compared with unexposed cells. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dadachova&quot; /&gt; Similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to non-ionizing radiation, suggesting that melanotic fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth.

However, melanization may come at some metabolic cost to the fungal cells: in the absence of radiation, some non-melanized fungi (that had been mutated in the melanin pathway) grew faster than their melanized counterparts. Limited uptake of nutrients due to the melanin molecules in the fungal cell wall or toxic intermediates formed in melanin biosynthesis have been suggested to contribute to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadachova&quot; /&gt;  It is consistent with the observation that despite being capable of producing melanin, many fungi do not synthesize melanin constitutively (i.e., all the time), but often only in response to external stimuli or at different stages of their development &lt;ref name=&quot;Calvo&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Calvo AM, Wilson RA, Bok JW, Keller NP|year= 2002|title=Relationship between secondary metabolism and fungal development|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev.|volume=66|pages=447–459|pmid=12208999|doi=10.1128/MMBR.66.3.447-459.2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The exact biochemical processes in the suggested melanin-based synthesis of organic compounds or other [[metabolite]]s for fungal growth, including the chemical intermediates (such as native electron donor and acceptor molecules) in the fungal cell and the location and chemical products of this process, are unknown.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]]. Work in this field is being used to more precisely determine the nature of our own cognition and also to help achieve more rigorous determinations of what [[individual rights]] non-human species should be afforded.

The justness of the current rights of the great apes, particularly, are being questioned as their cause is championed by the [[Great Ape Project]]. As the nature of our perceptions of individual rights and the role of intelligence and awareness in their determination are given more concrete bases, other species such as some [[porpoises]], held in popular belief for some time as highly intelligent, will likely become of greater interest in this regard. Even some species of [[birds]] have demonstrated what could potentially be [[conceptualization]] of the minds of their competitors.

From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hoyle's fallacy''' is a term for the statistical analysis of Sir [[Fred Hoyle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abiogenesis Calculations&quot;&gt; [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations] - An explanation at the [[TalkOrigins Archive]] by Ian Musgrave Last Update: December 21, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoyle's formulation concerns the probability that a [[protein]] molecule could achieve a [[function (biology)|functional]] sequence of [[amino acids]] by chance alone.  He calculates this as being of approximately the same order of magnitude as the probability that a hurricane could sweep through a junkyard and randomly assemble a [[Boeing 747]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abiogenesis Calculations&quot;/&gt; 

Hoyle's argument is a mainstay of [[creationist]], [[intelligent design]], [[orthogenetic]] and other criticisms of evolution.  It has been labeled a [[fallacy]] by [[Richard Dawkins]], principally in his two books ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abiogenesis Calculations&quot;/&gt; He has expanded the argument in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', calling it the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]].

According to Ian Musgrave in ''Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations'':
{{quote|These people, including Fred, have committed one or more of the following errors.
#They calculate the probability of the formation of a &quot;modern&quot; protein, or even a complete bacterium with all &quot;modern&quot; proteins, by random events. This is not the [[abiogenesis]] theory at all.
#They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.
#They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.
#They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.
#They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abiogenesis Calculations&quot;/&gt;}}

'''The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online''' (or '''Darwin Online''') is a freely-accessible website  containing the complete print and manuscript works of [[Charles Darwin]], as well as related supplementary material.  

== Overview ==

Darwin Online is an online research project based at the University of Cambridge.  It aims to provide all available print and manuscript material except unpublished letters, which are being made available separately by the [[Darwin Correspondence Project]].  In addition Darwin Online includes the largest bibliographical list of Darwin's publications and the largest union catalogue of Darwin papers and manuscripts. The site also provides an extensive collection of related materials such as reviews of Darwin's books, descriptions of his Beagle specimens, obituaries and recollections and works cited or read by Darwin. There is also general history and commentary--some from published sources and some prepared for the project.   

The project began  in 2002 and first produced a pilot website, ''The writings of Charles Darwin on the web'', replaced in October 2006 by the new website.  The launch was widely reported, &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Charles Darwin's works go online&quot; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6064364.stm BBC, Oct. 19, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Interview with John van Wyhe [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/artikel/699/89610/] &lt;/ref&gt; and the project has been widely reviewed by professional publications in biology &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Darwin unlimited,&quot; by N. Williams in   [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982206023712 '''Current Biology,''' 16(22) R938] &lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Life online&quot;  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/pdf/443746a.pdf  Nature] &lt;/ref&gt;,  and librarianship. &lt;ref&gt; Review: The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online in [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december06/12featured-collection.html D-Lib Magazine]  &lt;/ref&gt;

The site contains at least one copy of all known Darwin publications, both as searchable text (66,000 pages)  and full colour images (80,000 images). Most of this material was not previously available on  the internet &amp;ndash; or even never reproduced in any form. New items are still being found and added, along with further editions and translations. 
In April 2008 Darwin's private papers were launched. The event marked the largest release of new materials by and about Darwin ever published. The collection covers c. 20,000 items across c. 90,000 electronic images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[genetics]], the '''most recent common ancestor''' ('''MRCA''') of any set of [[organism]]s is the most recent individual from which all organisms in the group are directly [[Common descent|descended]].  The term is often applied to [[human]] [[genealogy]].

The MRCA of a set of individuals can sometimes be determined by referring to an established pedigree.
However, in general, it is impossible to identify the specific MRCA of a set of individuals, but an estimate of the time at which the MRCA lived can often be given; such estimates can be given based on DNA test results and established [[mutation rate]]s, or by reference to a non-genetic genealogical model.  

The term ''MRCA'' is usually used to describe a common ancestor of individuals within a species.  It can also be used to describe a common ancestor between species.  To avoid confusion, '''last common ancestor''' ('''LCA''') or the equivalent term '''concestor''' is sometimes used in place of MRCA when discussing ancestry between species.

The term ''MRCA'' may also be used to to identify a common ancestor between a set of organism via specific gene pathways. [[Mitochondrial Eve]] and [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] are examples of such MRCAs.

== MRCA of all living humans ==
Tracing one person's lineage back in time forms a [[binary tree]] of parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so on. However, the number of individuals in such an ancestor tree [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]] and will eventually become impossibly high. For example, a single individual alive today would over 30 generations, going back to about the [[High Middle Ages]], have &lt;math&gt;2^{30}&lt;/math&gt; or roughly a billion ancestors, more than the total [[world population]] at the time. &lt;ref name=&quot;River_Out_of_Eden&quot;&gt;See the chapter ''All Africa and her progenies'' in {{cite book | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | title = [[River Out of Eden]] | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-465-06990-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, an ancestor tree is not a binary tree. Rather, [[pedigree collapse]] changes the binary tree to a [[directed acyclic graph]].

Consider the formation, one generation at a time, of the ancestor graph of all currently living humans with no descendants. Start with living people with no descendants at the bottom of the graph. Adding the parents of all those individuals at the top of the graph will connect (half-)siblings via one or two common ancestors, their parent(s). Adding the next generation will connect all first cousins. As each of the following generations of ancestors is added to the top of the graph, the relationship between more and more people is mapped (second cousins, third cousins and so on). Eventually a generation is reached where one or more of the many top-level ancestors is an MRCA from whom it is possible to trace a path of direct descendants all the way down to every living person at the bottom generations of the graph.

The MRCA of everyone alive today could thus have co-existed with a large human population, most of whom either have no living descendants today or else are ancestors of a subset of people alive today. The existence of an MRCA does therefore not imply the existence of a [[population bottleneck]] or [[first couple]].

It is incorrect to assume that the MRCA passed all of his or her genes (or indeed any single gene) down to every person alive today.  Because of [[sexual reproduction]], at every generation, an ancestor only passes half of his or her genes to the next generation. The percentage of genes inherited from the MRCA becomes smaller and smaller at every successive generation, eventually decreasing to zero (at which point the [[Ship of Theseus paradox]] arises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhaxybayeva, Olga; Lapierre, Pascal; Gogarten, J.

===Time estimates===

Depending on the survival of isolated lineages without admixture from Modern [[human migration|migrations]] and taking into account long-isolated peoples, such as historical tribes in central Africa, Australia and remote islands in the South Pacific, the human MRCA was generally assumed to have lived in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]  period.

However, Rohde,  Olson, and Chang (2004)&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2004&quot;/&gt;, using a non-genetic model, estimated that the MRCA of all living humans may have lived within historical times ([[3rd millennium BC]] to [[1st millennium AD]]). Rohde (2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2005&quot;&gt;Rohde, DLT , ''[http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf On the common ancestors of all living humans]''. Submitted to American Journal of Physical Anthropology. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; refined the simulation with parameters from estimated  historical [[human migrations]] and of population densities. For conservative parameters, he pushes back the date for the MRCA to the [[6th millennium BC]] (p. 20), but still concludes with a &quot;surprisingly recent&quot; estimate of a MRCA living in the second or first millennium BC (p. 27). An explanation of this result is that, while humanity's MRCA was indeed a Paleolithic individual up to [[early modern]] times, the [[Age of Discovery|European explorers]] of the 16th and 17th centuries would have fathered enough offspring so that some &quot;mainland&quot; ancestry by today pervades even remote habitats. The possibility remains, however, that a single isolated population with no recent &quot;mainland&quot; admixture persists somewhere, which would immediately push back the date of humanity's MRCA by many millennia. While simulations help estimate probabilities, the question can be resolved authoritatively only by genetically testing every living human individual.

Other models reported in Rohde, Olson, and Chang (2004)&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2004&quot;/&gt; suggest that the MRCA of [[Western Europe]]ans lived as recently as AD 1000. The same article provides surprisingly recent estimates for the [[identical ancestors point]], the most recent time when each person then living was either an ancestor of all the persons alive today or an ancestor of none of them. The estimates for this are similarly uncertain, but date to considerably earlier than the MRCA, according to Rohde (2005) roughly to between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2005&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;/&gt;.

==MRCA of different species==

{{PhylomapA|size=300px|caption=[[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary tree]] showing the divergence of modern species from the [[last universal ancestor]] in the center.&lt;ref name=Ciccarelli&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ciccarelli FD, Doerks T, von Mering C, Creevey CJ, Snel B, Bork P |title=Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5765 |pages=1283&amp;ndash;87 |year=2006 |pmid=16513982 |doi=10.1126/science.1123061}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three [[Domain (biology)|domains]] are colored, with [[bacteria]] blue, [[archaea]] green, and [[eukaryote]]s red.}}
{{Further|[[Last universal ancestor]], [[The Ancestor's Tale#List of rendezvous points|List of concestors in The Ancestor's Tale]] }}

It is also possible to use the term MRCA to describe the common ancestor of two or more different species.  In the past, the term MRCA was used interchangeably with '''last common ancestor''' ('''LCA''') to denote both the common ancestor within a species and that between species.  But MRCA is now more frequently used to describe common ancestors within a species.  On the other hand, LCA now describes the common ancestor between two species.

The concept of the last common ancestor is described in [[Richard Dawkins]]' book, ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'', in which he imagines a 'pilgrimage' backwards in time, during which we [[human]]s travel back through our own evolutionary history and as we do so are joined at each successive stage by all the other species of [[organism]] with which we share each respective common ancestor. Dawkins uses the word &quot;'''concestor'''&quot; (coined by Nicky Warren) as an alternative to LCA.

In ''[[The Ancestor's Tale]]'', following the [[human evolution]]ary tree backwards, we first meet the concestor which we share with the species that are our closest relatives, the [[chimpanzee]] and [[bonobo]]. Dawkins estimates this to have occurred between 5 and 7 million years ago. Another way of looking at this is to say that our (approximately) 250,000-greats-grandparent was a creature from which all humans, chimpanzees and bonobos are directly descended.  Further on in Dawkins' imaginary journey, we meet the concestor we share with the [[Gorilla]], our next nearest relative, then the [[Orangutan]], and so on, until we finally meet the concestor of all living organisms, known as the [[last universal ancestor]].

==MRCA of a set of organisms via a single gene pathway==
{{main|Coalescent theory}}

It is also possible to consider the ancestry of individual [[gene]]s ([[coalescent theory]]), instead of a person (an organism) as a whole.  Unlike organisms, a gene is passed down from a generation of organisms to the next generation either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated ''descendant genes''. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via [[sexual reproduction]], a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants.  An organism has at least two ancestors (immediate parents), but a gene always has one single ancestor.

Given any gene in the body of a person, we can trace a single chain of ''human ancestors'' back in time, following the lineage of this one gene. Because a typical organism is built from tens of thousands of genes, there are numerous ways to trace the ancestry of organisms using this mechanism. But all these inheritance pathways share one common feature. If we start with all humans alive in 1995 and trace their ancestry by one particular gene (actually a [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]), we find that the farther we move back in time, the smaller the number of ancestors becomes. The pool of ancestors continues to shrink until we find the ''[[most recent common ancestor]]'' (MRCA) of all humans who were alive in 1995, ''via this particular gene pathway''.&lt;ref name=&quot;River_Out_of_Eden&quot;/&gt;

===Patrilineal and matrilineal MRCA===
{{main|Mitochondrial Eve|Y-chromosomal Adam}}

In theory, one can also trace human ancestry via a single chromosome, as a chromosome contains a set of genes and is passed down from parents to children via [[independent assortment]] from only one of the two parents. But [[genetic recombination]] ([[chromosomal crossover]]) mixes genes from non-sister [[chromatids]] from both parents during [[meiosis]], thus muddling the ancestry path.

However, the [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is nearly immune to sexual mixing, unlike the [[nuclear DNA]] whose chromosomes are shuffled and recombined in [[Mendelian inheritance]]. Mitochondrial DNA, therefore, can be used to trace [[matrilineal|matrilineal inheritance]] and to find the [[Mitochondrial Eve]] (also known as the ''African Eve''), the most recent common ancestor of all humans via the mitochondrial DNA pathway.

Mitochondrial Eve and the most recent common [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] ancestor of all living male humans, known as [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], have been established by researchers using [[Genealogical DNA test|tests of the same kinds of DNA]] as for two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Notions such as [[Mitochondrial Eve]] and [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] yield common ancestors that are more ancient than for all living humans (Hartwell 2004:539).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived about 140,000 years ago.  Y-chromosomal Adam is estimated to have lived around 60,000 years ago.  The MRCA of humans alive today would therefore need to have lived more recently than either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;/&gt;

== Identical ancestors point ==
{{main|Identical ancestors point}}
The MRCA had many contemporary companions of both sexes.  Many of these contemporaries left direct descendants, but not all of them left an unbroken link of descendants all the way down to today's population.  That is, some contemporaries of the MRCA are ancestors of no one in the current population.  The rest of the contemporaries of the MRCA may claim ancestry over a subset of current population, but not the entirety of current population.

Because ancestors of the MRCA are by definition also common ancestors, the farther we push back in time, the more common ancestors we find, from this single MRCA.  Eventually we reach a point in the past where all humans can be divided into two groups: those who left no descendants today and those who are common ancestors of all living humans today.  This point in time is termed the ''identical ancestors point''. Even though each living person receives genes (in original or mutated forms) in dramatically different proportions from these ancestors from the identical ancestors point,&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2004&quot;&gt;Rohde DLT, Olson S, Chang JT (2004) &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15457259 Modelling the recent common ancestry of all living humans]&quot;. ''Nature'' 431: 562-566.&lt;/ref&gt; from this point back all living people share exactly the same set of ancestors, all the way to the very first single-celled organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;River_Out_of_Eden&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only [[planet]] currently known to harbor [[life]]. The release of this image prompted the formulation of the proposition that the Earth was alive, and fostered acceptance of that proposition.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}]]

'''Gaia spore''' is a subset of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], the concept that Earth's [[ecosystem]]s can be treated as a single unified [[organism]]. The Gaia spore concept states that [[Gaia]] can reproduce via [[space colonization]]. Despite the ecological damage caused by the emergence of human technology within Gaia, their emergence is seen as an essential part of Gaia's reproduction via spreading of earth's ecosystems to other planets. The '''Gaia spore''' concept is an explanation of the purpose of human industry within the broader Gaia-[[ecology|ecological]] value perspective.  A typical '''Gaia spore''' would be a spaceship containing humans and other organisms travelling to another habitable location far away from Earth.

==History==
The Gaia spore concept was first formulated in 1998 as a framework to help the moral interpretation for the inherent conflict between the emergent ecological value systems and predominant techno-economic value systems.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

== Theories ==
The Gaia spore concept is largely a moral tool to interpret the value of human technology within a moral system which places significant value on helping to preserve and protect Earth's ecological systems. Such a Gaia-centric moral system is antagonistic of human progress because of the increased [[ecological footprint]] and strain on Earth's ecosystems caused by increases in [[World population|human population]] and technological development.
 
The Gaia spore theory was formed to provide a context to answer the question &quot;what is the value of human progress&quot; from an ecological perspective.

== Interpretation ==
The Gaia Spore concept can be interpreted on a number of different levels: [[technological]], [[humanistic]] and [[moral]].

From a technological perspective, the Gaia spore concept represents a number of engineering and scientific challenges. These challenges are largely being addressed by [[NASA]] in exploring other planets, searching for [[habitable planets]] beyond our solar system, [[spacecraft propulsion]] and [[human spaceflight]]. Specific technologies like [[life support system]]s and [[antimatter propulsion]] may be required to successfully develop the Gaia spore vessel.

From a humanistic perspective, the Gaia spore concept represents a critical insurance for humanity's survival. Well known Physicist Professor [[Stephen Hawking]] has warned that the human race must move to a planet beyond our Solar System to protect the future of the human species. &lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6158855.stm
 | title=MMove to new planet, says Hawking | last=RD | first=RD | date=[[2006-11-30]] | publisher=bbcnews.com | accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Space and survival]])

From a moral interpretation perspective, the Gaia spore concept has value in resolving the perceived conflict between ecological and humanistic value systems. Human activity which is necessary to sustain the economic [[wealth]] required for the development of the Gaia spore is seen as acceptable to Gaia as would be the physical hardship incurred in the process of [[reproduction]] by other living organisms. This framework provides a guideline for economic development but also environmental stewardship.

== Technological Challenges ==
Because of the complexity and interdependence of Earth's life forms, and the considerable distance to other habitable planets, there are a number of challenges to [[space colonization]].
=== Gaia Reproduction ===
Gaia is defined as a highly complex web of interactions between the five kingdoms of biology. Developing a [[biosphere]] which is capable of sustained survival is challenging, as shown by the results of the [[Biosphere 2]] experiments which began in 1985 and had difficulty maintaining a balanced environment.

=== Potential Gaia Progeny ===
[[Gliese 581 c]] is a &quot;[[super-earth]]&quot; [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting the [[red dwarf]] [[star]] [[Gliese 581]].&lt;ref name=&quot;space.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | last=Than | first=Ker | date=[[2007-04-24]] | publisher=space.com | accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to be the first ''terrestrial'' extrasolar planet discovered in the hypothetical [[habitable zone]] surrounding its star, where [[surface temperature]]s might maintain liquid [[water]]&lt;ref name=&quot;space.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;holygrail&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_exoplanet_side.html | title=Planet Hunters Edge Closer to Their Holy Grail  | last=Than | first=Ker | date=[[2007-02-24]] | publisher=space.com | accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore potentially be suitable for life as known on [[Earth]]. This makes it a hypothetically habitable location to support an earthlike ecology. The planet is astronomically close, at 20.4 [[light-year|light year]]s (193 trillion km or 119 trillion miles) from [[Earth]] in the direction of the constellation of [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6589157.stm |title=New 'super-Earth' found in space |accessdate = 2007-04-25 |date=[[25 April]] [[2007]] |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its star is identified as Gliese 581 by its number in the [[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars]]; with respect to Earth it is the 87th closest star system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The 100 Nearest Stars | publisher = RECONS | url = http://www.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.2007.0426.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gliese 581 c is the first extrasolar planet believed to possibly have a surface temperature similar to that of Earth. It is the smallest extrasolar planet around a [[main sequence]] star discovered to date. The planet is about 50 percent larger and five times heavier than Earth&lt;ref name=&quot;space.com&quot; /&gt;.

[[Mars]], the fourth planet in our solar system, is a [[terrestrial planet]] which has a thin [[atmosphere]]. Currently, however the atmospheric pressure and temperatures on Mars would not be able to support earth's ecology without significant [[terraforming]].

== Strategic Approach ==
Within the [[Gaia Hypothesis]], and within the further hypothesis that humans will be the mean by which Gaia reproduces, there are different strategic approaches to developing the technology and wealth required to allow [[space colonization]]. 
Two examples these strategic approaches to space colonization are &quot;the sprint&quot; or &quot;the marathon&quot;.

===The &quot;Sprint&quot;===
Humanity's current trajectory appears to be &quot;the sprint&quot; trajectory which involves a quick ecologically unsustainable build-up of wealth in order to allow the development of the gaia spore but in the end will lead to an exhaustion of Earth's resources and ultimately cause severe damage to Gaia{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. Gaia will no doubt recover from this abuse as it has in the past from the other extinctions, but humanity may not{{Fact|date=October 2007}}. This strategy has the advantage of reducing the Gaia's exposure time to the risk of major non-[[anthropogenic]] [[extinction events]] but is dangerous in that it risks humanity's own [[life support system]].

===The &quot;Marathon&quot;===
A &quot;Marathon&quot; trajectory may also be possible. This strategy is a low ecological impact method of [[space colonization]] which is more ecologically sustainable{{Fact|date=October 2007}} and ultimately reaches a steady state which could allow multiple colonizations over time. This strategy would first involve reducing Humanity's impact on the Earth to a stable and sustainable level and then gradually developing the wealth required to build the Gaia spore. This strategy has the advantage of protecting Gaia's [[life support system]] but could put Gaia at a higher risk of non-[[anthropogenic]] [[extinction events]]
before reproduction.

The '''molecular clock ''' (based on the '''molecular clock hypothesis''' ('''MCH''')) is a technique in [[molecular evolution]] to relate the time that two [[species]] [[speciation|diverged]] to the number of molecular differences measured between the species' [[DNA sequence]]s or proteins. It is sometimes called a '''gene clock''' or '''evolutionary clock'''.

==Early discovery and genetic equidistance==
The notion of the existence of a so-called &quot;molecular clock&quot; was first attributed to [[Emile Zuckerkandl]] and [[Linus Pauling]] who, in 1962, noticed that the number of [[amino acid]] differences in [[hemoglobin]] between different lineages roughly changes with time, as estimated also from fossil evidence.&lt;ref name=Zuckerkand62&gt; {{cite book | author = [[Emile Zuckerkandl|Zuckerkandl, E.]] and [[Linus Pauling|Pauling, L.B.]] | year = 1962 | title = Horizons in Biochemistry | chapter = Molecular disease, evolution, and genetic heterogeneity | editor = Kasha, M. and Pullman, B (editors) | pages = 189–225 | publisher = Academic Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They generalized this observation to assert that the rate of [[evolution]]ary change of any specified [[protein]] was approximately constant over time and over different lineages. 

The '''Genetic equidistance''' phenomenon was first noted in 1963. The author wrote: &quot;It appears that the number of residue differences between [[cytochrome C]] of any two species is mostly conditioned by the time elapsed since the lines of evolution leading to these two species originally diverged. If this is correct, the cytochrome c of all mammals should be equally different from the cytochrome c of all birds. Since fish diverges from the main stem of vertebrate evolution earlier than either birds or mammals, the cytochrome c of both mammals and birds should be equally different from the cytochrome c of fish. Similarly, all vertebrate cytochrome c should be equally different from the yeast protein.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margoliash, E. (1963). Primary Structure And Evolution Of Cytochrome C. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 50, 672-679.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the difference between the cytochrome C of a carp and a frog, turtle, chicken, rabbit, and horse is a very constant 13% to 14%. Similarly, the difference between the cytochrome C of a bacterium and yeast, wheat, moth, tuna, pigeon, and horse ranges from 64% to 69%. Together with the work of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, the genetic equidistance result directly led to the formal postulation of the molecular clock hypothesis in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar S: Molecular clocks: four decades of evolution. Nat Rev Genet 2005, 6(8):654-662.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic equidistance has often been used to infer equal time of separation of different sister species from an outgroup. &lt;ref&gt;Pesole G, Gissi C, De Chirico A, Saccone C. Nucleotide substitution rate of mammalian mitochondrial genomes. J Mol Evol. 1999;48:427-34. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang, S. (2008) The genetic equidistance result of molecular evolution is independent of mutation rates. J. Comp. Sci. Syst. Biol., 1: 92-102. http://omicsonline.com/ArchiveJCSB/Ab01/JCSB1.092.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Allan Wilson]] and [[Vincent Sarich]] built upon this work and the work of [[Motoo Kimura]] observed and formalized that rare spontaneous errors in [[DNA replication]] cause the [[mutation]]s that drive [[molecular evolution]], and that the accumulation of evolutionarily &quot;neutral&quot; differences between two sequences could be used to measure time, if the error rate of DNA replication could be calibrated.&lt;ref name=Kimura68&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimura |first=Motoo |year=1968 |title= Evolutionary rate at the molecular level |journal= Nature |volume=217 |pages=624–626 |url= http://biptest.weizmann.ac.il/course/evogen/Neutral/kimura.pdf |doi= 10.1038/217624a0 |format= {{Dead link|date=June 2008}} &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AKimura+intitle%3AEvolutionary+rate+at+the+molecular+level&amp;as_publication=Nature&amp;as_ylo=1968&amp;as_yhi=1968&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarich67&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Vincent Sarich|Sarich, V.M.]] and [[Allan Wilson|Wilson, A.C.]] |year=1967 |title=Immunological time scale for hominid evolution |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=158 |issue=3805 |pages=1200–1203 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3805.1200 |pmid=4964406}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of calibrating the error rate was to use as references pairs of groups of living species whose date of speciation was already known from the fossil record.

==Calibration==
Originally, the possibility was explored that all of the variables influencing DNA replication error-rate might cancel somewhat and show some level of constancy when averaged over time, across species and over parts of the [[genome]]. Because the enzymes that replicate DNA only vary slightly between species, the assumption might have seemed reasonable ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' to Pauling or Zuckerkandl as ''[[in vitro]]'' biochemists. This pioneering effort to integrate the fields of evolutionary and molecular biology can be said to have set aside the variation in rate of DNA repair and [[natural selection]] in time, space, and across [[taxa]] until molecular evidence accumulated enough to make those variations suitable topics of study in their own light.  While the MCH cannot be blindly assumed to be true, individual molecular clocks ''can'' be tested for accuracy and utilized in many cases. In general terms, they need to be [[calibration|calibrated]] against material evidence such as fossils before firm conclusions can be based on them (see also Lovette&lt;ref name=Lovette04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lovette, I.J. |year=2004 |title=Mitochondrial dating and mixed support for the &quot;2% Rule&quot; in birds |journal=[[Auk (journal)|Auk]] |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=1–6|url= |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[0001:MDAMSF]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Measures in regions of low selection (silent substitutions) showed rates of 0.7-0.8% per [[Myr]] in bacteria, mammals, invertebrates, and plants.&lt;ref name=Ochman87&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ochman H, Wilson AC. |journal=J Mol Evol.| year=1987| pages=74–86.|title=Evolution in bacteria: evidence for a universal substitution rate in cellular genomes | volume=26|doi=10.1007/BF02111283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, genomic regions of very high selection (encoding rRNA) were considerably slower (1% per 50 Myr).

In addition to such variation in rate with genomic position, since the early 1990s, variation among taxa has proven fertile ground for research too,&lt;ref name=Douzery03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douzery, E.J.P., Delsuc, F., Stanhope, M.J. and Huchon, D. |year=2003 |title= Local molecular clocks in three nuclear genes: divergence times for rodents and other mammals, and incompatibility among fossil calibrations|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume= 57|pages=S201–S213|url=  |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-0028-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; even over comparatively short periods of evolutionary time (for example [[mockingbird]]s&lt;ref name=Hunt01&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hunt, J.S., Bermingham, E., and Ricklefs, R.E. |year=2001 |title=Molecular systematics and biogeography of Antillean thrashers, tremblers, and mockingbirds (Aves: Mimidae) |journal=[[Auk (journal)|Auk]] |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=35–55|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3793/is_200101/ai_n8930531 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2001)118[0035:MSABOA]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
). [[Procellariiformes|Tube-nosed seabirds]] have molecular clocks that on average run at half speed of many other birds,&lt;ref name=Rheindt05&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rheindt, F. E. and Austin, J. |year=2005 |title=Major analytical and conceptual shortcomings in a recent taxonomic revision of the Procellariiformes - A reply to Penhallurick and Wink (2004) |journal=[[Emu (journal)|Emu]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=181–186|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=MU04039.pdf |doi=10.1071/MU04039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to long [[generation]] times, and many turtles have a molecular clock running at one-eighth the speed it does in small mammals or even slower.&lt;ref name=Avise92&gt;{{cite journal |author= Avise, J.C., Bowen, W., Lamb, T., Meylan, A.B. and Bermingham, E. |year= 1992 |title= Mitochondrial DNA Evolution at a Turtle's Pace: Evidence for Low Genetic Variability and Reduced Microevolutionary Rate in the Testudines |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 9|issue= 3|pages=457–473|url= http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/9/3/457 |month= May |day= 01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effects of [[small population size]] are also likely to confound molecular clock analyses; [[cheetah]]s for example, having gone through at least 2 population bottlenecks, could not be adequately studied based on a molecular clock model alone.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Researchers such as Ayala have more fundamentally challenged the molecular clock hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Ayala99&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ayala, F.J.|year=1999 |title=Molecular clock mirages |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=21|issue=1 |pages=71–75|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/60000186/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(199901)21:1&lt;71::AID-BIES9&gt;3.0.CO;2-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz06&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schwartz, J. H. and Maresca, B. |year=2006 |title=Do Molecular Clocks Run at All? A Critique of Molecular Systematics |journal=Biological Theory |volume=1 |pages=357–371|url=  |doi=10.1162/biot.2006.1.4.357|laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070210170623.htm|laysource=[[Science Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ayala's 1999 study, 5 factors combine to limit applications molecular clock models:

* Changing generation times (A mutation generally becomes fixed only from one generation to another. The shorter this timespan is, the more mutations can become fixed)
* Population size (Apart from effects of small population size, genetic diversity will &quot;bottom out&quot; as populations become larger as the fitness advantage of any one mutation becomes smaller)
* Species-specific differences (due to differing metabolism, ecology, evolutionary history,...)
* Evolving functions of the encoded protein (can be ameliorated by utilizing [[non-coding DNA]] sequences or emphasizing [[silent mutation]]s)
* Changes in the intensity of natural selection

Molecular clock users have developed workaround solutions using a number of statistical approaches including [[maximum likelihood]] techniques and later [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian modeling]]. In particular, models that take into account rate variation across lineages have been proposed in order to obtain better estimates of divergence times (and other parameters that may be estimated from substitution rates, such as effective population size.) These models are called '''relaxed molecular clocks'''&lt;ref name=Drummond06&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drummond, A.J., Ho, S.Y.W., Phillips, M.J. and Rambaut A. |year=2006 |title= Relaxed Phylogenetics and Dating with Confidence|journal= [[Public Library of Science|PLoS Biology]] |volume= 4|issue=5 |pages=e88|doi=  10.1371/journal.pbio.0040088}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they represent an intermediate position between the 'strict' molecular clock hypothesis and Felsenstein's many-rates model and are made possible through [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] techniques that explore a weighted range of tree topologies and simultaneously estimate parameters of the chosen substitution model. It must be remembered that these are still based on statistical [[inference]] and not on direct [[evidence]] and that therefore, [[Scientific method|strictly speaking]] even a relaxed molecular clock can only support but never ''[[prove]]'' a scientific hypothesis. This problem is approached by using the [[fossil record]], which quite often is good and well-documented enough to provide hard evidence, to calibrate the molecular clock accordingly&lt;ref name=Benton01&gt;{{cite journal |author=benton, M. J. and Donoghue, P. C. J. |year=200t |title= Paleontological evidence to date the Tree of Life|journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution|volume= 24|pages=26-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Alternatively, for viral phylogenetics and [[ancient DNA]] studies, two areas of evolutionary biology where it is possible to sample sequences over an evolutionary timescale, the dates of the sequence themselves can be used to calibrate the molecular clock.

==Uses==
The molecular clock technique is an important tool in [[molecular systematics]], the use of [[molecular genetics]] information to determine the correct [[scientific classification]] of organisms or to study variation in selective forces.

Knowledge of approximately-constant rate of molecular evolution in particular sets of lineages also facilitates establishing the dates of [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] events, including those not documented by [[fossils]], such as the divergence of living [[taxon|taxa]] and the formation of the [[phylogenetic tree]]. But in these cases - especially over long stretches of time - the limitations of MCH (above) must be considered &lt;!-- There is a critique in TREE journal that puts a good point on this --&gt;; such estimates may be off by 50% or more.

'''Thomas Henry Huxley''' [[Privy Councillor|PC]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] (4 May 1825 – 29 June 1895) was an [[English people|English]] [[biologist]], known as &quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot; for his advocacy of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica Online|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|famous 1860 debate]] with [[Samuel Wilberforce]] was a key moment in the wider acceptance of [[evolution]], and in his own career. Wilberforce was coached by [[Richard Owen]], against whom Huxley also debated on whether man was closely related to apes. Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as [[gradualism]], and was undecided about [[natural selection]], but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. He was instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, and fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition.

Huxley used the term '[[agnostic]]' to describe his own views on theology, a term whose use has continued to the present day (see [[Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism]]).

Huxley had little schooling, and taught himself almost everything he knew. Remarkably, he became perhaps the finest [[Comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] of the second half of the nineteenth century. He worked on [[invertebrates]], clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on [[vertebrates]], especially on the relationship between man and the apes. One important conclusion was that birds evolved from small carnivorous [[Theropoda|dinosaurs]], a view widely held today.
The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of [[evolution]], and by his extensive public work on scientific [[education]], both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Thomas Henry Huxley was born in [[Ealing]], then a village in [[Middlesex]]. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed,&lt;ref&gt;Bibby, amongst others, queried this account, which owes its origin to Leonard Huxley's biography (1900). Bibby, Cyril 1959. ''T.H. Huxley: scientist, humanist and educator''. Watts, London. p3-4&lt;/ref&gt; putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at 10, after only two years of formal schooling.

Despite this unenviable start, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great [[autodidacticism|autodidact]]s of the nineteenth century. At first he read [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[James Hutton]]'s Geology, [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]]'s Logic. In his teens he taught himself [[German language|German]], eventually becoming fluent and used by [[Charles Darwin]] as a translator of scientific material in German. He learnt Latin, and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original.
 
[[Image:Young Huxley RN.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Huxley, aged 21]]

Later on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert first on [[invertebrates]], and later on [[vertebrates]], all self-taught. He was skilled in drawing, and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than most of his clerical opponents. So, a boy who left school at ten became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments  using [[animal magnetism|mesmerism]] for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's [[Rotherhithe]] amidst the squalor endured by the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]ian poor. Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease at its worst.&lt;ref&gt;Chesney, Kellow 1970. ''The Victorian underworld''. Temple Smith, London; Pelican 1972, p105 and p421.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind [[University College Hospital]]), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder [[Marshall Hall (physiologist)|Marshall Hall]] discovered the [[reflex arc]]. All this time Huxley continued his program of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling.

A year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the [[Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries']] yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by the remarkable Scot, [[Thomas Wharton Jones]], who had been [[Robert Knox]]'s assistant when Knox bought cadavers from [[Burke and Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;The cut-price anatomy schools and Robert Knox are well treated in Desmond's account of materialist medical dissidents of the 1820s and 30s: Desmond A. 1989. ''The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine and reform in radical London''. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognized layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as [[Huxley's layer]]. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.

At twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the [[University of London]], winning the gold medal for [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. However, he did not present himself for the final (2nd M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voyage of the ''Rattlesnake''===
Aged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] for a licence to practice, yet he was 'deep in debt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p35&lt;/ref&gt; So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the [[Royal Navy]]. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a ''[[viva voce]]'').

[[Image:Rattlesnake2.jpg|thumb|left|190px|&lt;center&gt;HMS ''Rattlesnake''&lt;br /&gt;by ship's artist [[Oswald Brierly]]]]

Finally Huxley was made [[surgery|Assistant Surgeon]] ('surgeon's mate') to [[HMS Rattlesnake (1822)|HMS ''Rattlesnake'']], about to start for a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. ''Rattlesnake'' left England on 3 December 1846 and, once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by [[Edward Forbes]] FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley.

Huxley's paper ''On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae'' was published in 1849 by the [[Royal Society]] in its ''Philosophical Transactions''. Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of ''[[Hydrozoa]]''. The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the [[phylum]] now called the ''[[Cnidaria]]''. He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in ''The Oceanic Hydrozoa'', published by the [[Ray Society]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Di Gregorio|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hux.draw.1.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt; Australian woman: &lt;br /&gt;Pencil drawing by Huxley]]

The value of Huxley's work was recognized and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[John Tyndall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} p7, 9, 66, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of ''Rattlesnake''. He solved the problem of ''[[Appendicularia]]'', whose place in the animal kingdom [[Johannes Peter Müller]] had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the [[Ascidiacea|Ascidians]] are both, as Huxley showed, [[tunicates]], today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum ''[[Chordata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holland|2007|}} p153–5&lt;/ref&gt; Other papers on the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[cephalopod]]s and on [[brachiopod]]s and [[rotifer]]s are also noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898-1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rattlesnake's official naturalist, [[John MacGillivray]], did some work on botany, and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages. He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacGillivray|1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Huxley effectively resigned from the navy (by refusing to return to active service) and, in July 1854, he became Professor of Natural History at the [[Royal School of Mines]] and naturalist to the [[Geological Survey]] in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the [[Royal Institution]] 1855–58 and 1865–67; Hunterian Professor at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] 1863–69; President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] 1869–1870; and, later, President of the [[Royal Society]] 1883–85; and Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the Presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six month's leave. His pension was a fairly handsome £1500 a year.

In 1890, he moved from London to [[Eastbourne]] where he edited the nine volumes of his ''Collected Essays''. In 1894 he heard of the [[Eugene Dubois]]' discovery in Java of the remains of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (now known as ''[[Homo erectus]]''). Finally, in 1895, he died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia), and was buried in North London at [[East Finchley Cemetery|St Marylebone]]. This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved little son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley's wife is also buried there. No invitations were sent out, but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony; they included Hooker, Flower, Foster, Lankester, [[Joseph Lister]] and, apparently, [[Henry James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p230&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public duties and awards====
From 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. From 1862 to 1884 he served on eight [[Royal Commission]]s. From 1871–80 he was a Secretary of the [[Royal Society]] and from 1883–85 he was President. He was President of the [[Geological Society]] from 1868–70. In 1870, he was President of the [[British Association]] at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly-constituted [[London School Board]]. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before him, science was mostly a gentleman's occupation; after him, science was a profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|Huxley in perspective}} p235&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The [[Royal Society]], who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the [[Royal Medal]] the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award! He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the [[Copley Medal]] in 1888 and the [[Darwin Medal]] in 1894; the [[Geological Society]] awarded him the [[Wollaston Medal]] in 1876; the [[Linnean Society]] awarded him the [[Linnean Medal]] in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the ''Life and Letters''. He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of [[University College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T.H.Huxley-1880s.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Huxley &lt;br /&gt;by [[Alexander Bassano|Bassano]] c1883]]

In 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the North Star: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1998|}} p431&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany.

As recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state, and was appointed [[Privy Councillor]] in 1892.

There was so much achievement in his life that it seems extraordinary that he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin's proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisors, including Wilberforce)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment—he had vigorous debates in print with Prime Ministers [[Disraeli]], [[Gladstone]] and [[Arthur Balfour]], and his relationship with [[Lord Salisbury]] was less than tranquil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was &quot;''the'' premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyons|1999|}} p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation, but none were of his stature. The loss of [[Francis Balfour]] in 1882, climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge, was a tragedy. Huxley thought he was &quot;the only man who can carry out my work&quot;: the deaths of Balfour and [[William Kingdon Clifford|W.K. Clifford]] were &quot;the greatest losses to science in our time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrate palaeontology====
The first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the [[Phanerozoic]]. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the [[Palaeozoic]] era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.

Much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond A. 1982. ''Archetypes and ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London 1850-1875''. Muller, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of [[order (biology)|orders]] in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.

Huxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach: whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the ''relationships between groups''.

[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley by Theodore Blake Wirgman.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt; Huxley by Wirgman&lt;br /&gt; a drawing in pencil, 1882]]

The lobed-finned  fish (such as [[coelacanths]] and [[lung fish]]) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of [[tetrapods]], one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clack|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1861|}} p67–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898-1903|}} p163–187&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of ''[[Sauropsida]]''. His papers on ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and the [[origin of birds]] were of great interest then and still are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898-1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paul|2002|}} p171–224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prum|2003|}} p550–561&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate, and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by [[O.C. Marsh]], in [[Yale]]'s [[Peabody Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh was part palaeontologist, part robber baron, a man who had hunted buffalo and met [[Red Cloud]] (in 1874). Funded by his uncle [[George Peabody]], Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries: 
the huge [[Cretaceous]] aquatic bird ''[[Hesperornis]]'', and the dinosaur footprints along the [[Connecticut River]] were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special.

The collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling ''[[Orohippus]]'' from the Eocene through three-toed species such as ''[[Miohippus]]'' to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, we now know, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the [[Eocene]] to the [[Pleistocene]]: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see [[Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum]]). The modern account of the [[evolution of the horse]] has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.

The horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. And if so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when the Spanish arrived... That, however, is another story. The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.

==Darwin's bulldog==

{{see also|Reaction to Darwin's theory}}

Huxley was originally not persuaded of 'development theory' as evolution was once called. We can see that in his savage review&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1854|}} p425–439&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected [[Jean-Baptiste de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck|Lamarck's]] theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1855|}} p82–85&lt;/ref&gt;, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p222&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin's views before they were published (the group included [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Charles Lyell]]). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the [[Linnean Society]] in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to [[Asa Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|Wallace|1858|[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F350&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 45-62]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was &quot;How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900}} vol 1, p189&lt;/ref&gt; However, the correctness of natural selection as the main mechanism for evolution was to lie permanently in Huxley's mental pending tray. He never conclusively made up his mind about it, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.

Logically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.

Huxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the ''Origin'' in the ''Times'' for 26 December 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1893-94a|}} p1–20&lt;/ref&gt; and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in February 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898-1903|}} p400&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Richard Owen]], whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the ''Origin'' in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; also primed [[Samuel Wilberforce]] who wrote one in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', running to 17,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilberforce|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce's son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the ''Quarterly'':

[[Image:TH Huxley 41.5 KB.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Caricature of Huxley by&lt;br /&gt;Carlo Pellegrini in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' 1871]]

:&quot;Since [[Lord Brougham]] assailed Dr [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a &quot;flighty&quot; person, who endeavours &quot;to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,&quot; and whose &quot;mode of dealing with nature&quot; is reprobated as &quot;utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.&quot; 

:If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the 'Origin of Species' to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the ''Quarterly Review'' article... &lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Francis (ed) 1887. ''The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical chapter''. Murray, London, volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A more complete version is available in [[q:Thomas Henry Huxley|Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I am Darwin's bulldog&quot; said Huxley, and it is apt; the second half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, and the younger, combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from THH to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871)  goes &quot;The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin's] heels too much of late.&quot;

==== Debate with Wilberforce ====
{{main|1860 Oxford evolution debate}}

Famously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the [[British Association]] meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. He was joined at the debate by his and Darwin's friends Hooker and Lubbock, and they were opposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford, [[Samuel Wilberforce]], and [[Robert FitzRoy]], the captain of HMS Beagle. The chair for this debate was Darwins's former botany tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]], and flanking him on the platform were Dr John William Draper from New York, Rev Dingle, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], [[John Lubbock|Lubbock]], [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Brodie]], Professor Beale and Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p209, note 67&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' ''Vestiges''. For the more challenging task of opposing the ''Origin'', and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by [[Richard Owen]] – Owen stayed with him the night before the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991}} p493&lt;/ref&gt; On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his ''Quarterly Review'' article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether H. was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.

The letters of [[Alfred Newton]] include one to his brother giving an eye-witness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wollaston AFR 1921. ''Life of Alfred Newton: late Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Cambridge University 1866-1907, with a Preface by Sir [[Archibald Geikie]] OM''. Dutton, NY. p118–120&lt;/ref&gt; Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought ''he'' had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton: see notes 61, 66, 67, 78, 79, 80, 81, 84, 86, 87, 89, 90, 93, 95: p208-211]&lt;/ref&gt; The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley to Dr FD Dyster, 9th September 1860, Huxley Papers 15.117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|}} p118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}} Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p276–281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1979|}} p313–330. A pro-Wilberforce account; lists many sources, but ''not'' Alfred Newton's letter to his brother. Many of Lucas' points are treated adversely in Jensen 1991, for example, note 77, p209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1991}} Chapter 26 'Knight takes Bishop?' is Gould's take on the Huxley-Wilberforce debate.&lt;/ref&gt;

One effect of the debate was to increase hugely Huxley's visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin F. (ed) 1897-99. ''Life and letters of Charles Darwin''. 2 vols, Murray, London. I, 156-7 Darwin to Huxley: &quot;It is of enormous importance the showing the world that a few first-rate men are not afraid of expressing their opinion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin F. and A.C.Seward (eds) 1903. ''More letters of Charles Darwin''. 2 vols, Murray, London. II, 204 Leonard Huxley: &quot;The importance... lay in the open resistance that was made to authority&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the [[Old Testament]], especially the [[Book of Genesis]]. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial [[Essays and Reviews]]. Thus both on the side of science, and on the side of religion, the debate was important, and its outcome significant. &lt;ref&gt;Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p83-6&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[#Schools and the Bible|below]])

That Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education) says something about both men, whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled.

====Man's place in nature====
For nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with [[Richard Owen]], a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's [[Croonian Lecture]], delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on ''The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull'' was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's view that the bones of the skull and the spine were [[homology (biology)|homologous]], an opinion previously held by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Lorenz Oken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|Lankester|1898-1903|}} p538–606&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T.H.Huxley 1857.jpg|thumb|THH in 1857|&lt;center&gt;Huxley at 32]]

From 1860–63 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1862b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work ''Evidence as to Man's place in Nature'' (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before [[Charles Darwin]] published his ''[[Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.

Although Darwin did not publish his ''Descent of Man'' until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between [[Monboddo]] and [[Buffon]]). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the ''Origin'', he wrote: &quot;In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=506 p490]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when [[Richard Owen]] presented (to the Linnean Society) his view that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus ''Homo''. Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1858|}} p1–37&lt;/ref&gt; No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted &quot;Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burkhardt|1984 onwards (continuing series)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen's idea was completely wrong. 
[[Image:Huxley7.jpg|thumb|left|190px|&lt;center&gt; Huxley with sketch&lt;br /&gt;of a gorilla skull (c1870)]]

The subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley's friend [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. Thus was exposed one of Owen's greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate, but also a better anatomist. 

Owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cosans|2009}} p109&amp;ndash;111&lt;/ref&gt; 

Huxley's ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the ''Natural History Review'': &quot;the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature|Man's place in Nature]]'', with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain.&lt;ref&gt;For the full text see [[s:The cerebral structure of man and apes]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Collected Essays'' this addendum was edited out.&lt;ref&gt;see [[q:Thomas Henry Huxley]] for a shortened version of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.

The following was written by Huxley to [[George Rolleston|Rolleston]] before the 1861 BA meeting:
:&quot;My dear Rolleston... The obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts; and I greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the British Association in order to assist personally at what, I believe, will be ''the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months'' of the untruth of the three assertions, that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor, are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes. I shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the Section&quot; Yours faithfully, Thos. H. Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;''Athenaeum'' September 21, 1861 p498. [key sentence italicised]&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the [[Neanderthal]] skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-''sapiens'' discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1862a|}} p420–422&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps less productive was his work on physical anthropology, a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races as: Europeans, Mongolian, Negro (or Ethiopian) and Australian; each of these categories being broken down further into sub-sets. In fact all such anthropological classifications are put in the shade by our modern discovery that the genetic diversity of man in Africa is greater than exists in the rest of mankind put together.&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Doran M., Richard Villems et al. 2008.

====Natural selection====
Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.

Huxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type &quot;until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Variously worded in {{Harvnb|Huxley|1860a}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1860b}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1861}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1862b}} and {{Harvnb|Huxley1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Poulton|1896}} chapter 18 gives detailed quotations from Huxley and discussion—Darwin's letters to Huxley being not yet published&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory.

Darwin's part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: &quot;The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It's the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letters CD to THH in {{Harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903}} vol 1 p137–8, 225–6, 230-2, 274, 277, 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: &quot;it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|1991|}} p397&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, ''but not the question of mechanism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's resistance to Darwin's massaging and suasion is evidence of mental firmness; he may be Darwin's bulldog, but not his poodle. At least he went so far as to say that he knew of no better hypothesis.

==The X Club==
{{main|X Club}}

In November 1864 Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the [[X Club]], like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, [[John Tyndall]], [[J.D. Hooker]], [[John Lubbock]] (banker, biologist and cousin of Darwin), [[Herbert Spencer]] (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), [[William Spottiswoode]] (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), [[Thomas Archer Hirst|Thomas Hirst]] (Professor of Physics at University College London), [[Edward Frankland]] (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and [[George Busk]], zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for [[HMS Dreadnought (1801)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']]). All except Spencer were [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in [[glaciology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1857|}} p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1896|Ref=CITEREFTyndall1896|}} p338–339, 359, 379–383, 406. &quot;During the summer of 1857 he carefully experimented with coloured liquids on the [[Mer de Glace]] and its tributaries...&quot; [[Philosophical Magazine]] 1857, vol xiv p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyndall|1857|}} p327–346&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] and [[George Rolleston]], (Huxley protegées), and liberal clergyman [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Arthur Stanley]], the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] were entertained from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1970|}} p63–72&lt;/ref&gt;

They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the [[Copley Medal]] for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.

The next step was to acquire an organ for propaganda. This was the weekly ''Reader'', which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the ''Natural History Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p284, 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt; bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the ''NHR'' failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The ''Reader'' also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art &amp; literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him.

However, the experience gained with the ''Reader'' was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), [[Norman Lockyer]], who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, ''Nature'' issued a supplement devoted to Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}} p1&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873–85 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were [[Presidents of the Royal Society]] in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute wth Huxley over state support for science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p191&lt;/ref&gt; After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now [[Lord Avebury]]) was the last surviving member.

Huxley was also an active member of the [[Metaphysical Society]], which ran from 1869–80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irvine|1955}} Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined [[The Club]] (founded by [[Dr. Johnson]]) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational influence==
When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.

====School of Mines and Zoology====
In the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster.

The typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Osborn|1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own. [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; [[Ray Lankester|E. Ray Lankester]] became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|W.T. Thiselton-Dyer]] became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at [[University College, Cardiff]]; and William Rutherford&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p14, 60&lt;/ref&gt; became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]], Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. &quot;No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin to Asa Gray 1860 in {{Harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903|}} p153&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: &quot;The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lester|1995|}} p67&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir [[Arthur Shipley]] said &quot;[Although] Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wollaston|1921|}} p102&lt;/ref&gt; E.W MacBride said &quot;Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacBride|1934|}} p65&lt;/ref&gt;  To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.

[[Image:Huxley5.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Huxley (c. 1890)]]

This largely [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] program of [[comparative anatomy]] remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]], [[Fritz Müller]], [[Henry Bates]]) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. [[Michael Ruse]] finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Desmond suggests that &quot;[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p273, note 20&lt;/ref&gt; That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.

Huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths.

====Schools and the Bible====
Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870 he was voted onto the [[London School Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p19–20&lt;/ref&gt; In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example is his famous essay ''On a piece of chalk'' [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE8/Chalk.html] first published in ''Macmillan's Magazine'' in London, 1868. The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain, from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as &quot;organized common sense&quot;.

Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. &quot;I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Said of those who wished to abolish all religious teaching, when really all they wanted was to free education from the Church. THH 1873. ''Critiques and Addresses'' p90&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, what Huxley proposed was to create an ''edited version'' of the Bible, shorn of &quot;shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1893-94b|}} p397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p153&lt;/ref&gt; The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said &quot;I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;School Board Chronicle vol 2, p326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibby 1959 p=155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p155&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.

It may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said &quot;It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayr|1982|}} p80&lt;/ref&gt; — and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern [[Christian apologists]] consider Huxley the father of [[atheistic evangelism]], though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all forms of organised religion, especially the &quot;Roman Church... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bibby 1959 p=155&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;School Board Chronicle vol 2, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps [[Lenin]] was right when he remarked (in ''Materialism and empirio-criticism'') &quot;In Huxley's case... agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism&quot; (see also [[#Debate with Wilberforce|above]]).

====Adult education====
Huxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', the ''Saturday Review'', the ''Reader'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', ''Macmillan's Magazine'', the ''Contemporary Review''. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2003|}} p69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: articles are listed, and some are available, in The Huxley File at Clark University&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in [[Blackfriars Road]]. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. [[Maurice]]'s [[Christian Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1959|}} p33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p361–362&lt;/ref&gt; At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994}} Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Huxley6.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Huxley (c. 1890)]]

The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was ''The physical basis of life'', a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme — that vital action is nothing more than &quot;the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it&quot; — shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the ''Fortnightly Review'' for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said &quot;No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morley|1917}} p90&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was reprinted seven times and [[protoplasm]] became a household word; [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.

The topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the [[cytoplasmic streaming]] in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century.

When the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on [[August Comte]]'s [[positivism]], Huxley corrected him: &quot;Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity&quot; (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays ''Methods &amp; Results'' 156). A later version was &quot;[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed&quot;. (lecture on ''The scientific aspects of positivism'' Huxley 1870 ''Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews'' p149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain.

====Huxley and the humanities====
During his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, James G. ''T.H. Huxley: Man's place in nature''. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Houston 1932. ''Huxley: prophet of science''. Longmans Green, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T.H. 1893-4. ''Collected essays'': vol 4 ''Science and Hebrew tradition''; vol 5 ''Science and Christian tradition''; vol 6 ''Hume, with helps to the study of Berkeley''; vol 7 ''Man's place in nature''; vol 9: ''Evolution and ethics, and other essays''. Macmillan, London. &lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known of these topics is evolution and ethics, which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson [[Julian Huxley]] gave [[Romanes Lectures]] on this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T.H. and Huxley J. 1947. ''Evolution and ethics 1893-1943''. Pilot, London. In USA as ''Touchstone for ethics'', Harper, N.Y. [includes text from the Romanes lectures of both T.H. Huxley and Julian Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradis, James &amp; Williams, George C 1989. ''Evolution and Ethics: T.H. Huxley's 'Evolution and Ethics', with new essays on its Victorian and sociobiological context''. Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed J.R. 'Huxley and the question of morality'. In {{Harvnb|Barr|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority (as did [[Matthew Arnold]]). Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore [[inherited]].

Despite this, the ''details'' of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the ''struggle for existence''. It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see [[Ethics]] and [[Evolutionary ethics]]). This seems to put Huxley as a [[Free will#compatibilism|compatibilist]] in the [[Free Will]] vs [[Determinism]] debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend [[Herbert Spencer]].
:&quot;Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture.&quot; letter THH to W. Platt Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}} vol 2, p285&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's dissection of [[Rousseau]]'s views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau's ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is:
:&quot;The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Huxley T.H. 1890. The natural inequality of man. ''Nineteenth Century'' January; reprinted in ''Collected Essays'' vol 1, p290–335&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jensen|1991|}}, p196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal and other commissions==
Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1900|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Commission]] is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.

====Royal Commissions====
*1862     Trawling for herrings on the coast of Scotland.
*1863–65  Sea fisheries of the United Kingdom.
*1870–71  The [[Contagious Diseases Acts]].
*1870–75  Scientific instruction and the advancement of science.
*1876     The practice of subjugating live animals to scientific experiments ([[vivisection]]).
*1876–78  The universities of Scotland.
*1881–82  The Medical Acts. [i.e. the legal framework for medicine]
*1884     Trawl, net and beam trawl fishing.

====Other commissions====
*1866     On the Royal College of Science for Ireland.
*1868     On science and art instruction in Ireland.

==Family==
{{See also|Huxley family}}
[[Image:THH by Collier.jpg|thumb|Pencil drawing of Huxley by his daughter, Marion]]

In 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825–1915), an English émigrée whom he had met in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons:
*Noel Huxley (1856–60), died aged 4.
*Jessie Oriana Huxley (1856–1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.
*Marian Huxley (1859–87), married artist [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]] in 1879.
*[[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]], (1860–1933) author.
*Rachel Huxley (1862–1934) married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884; he died 1895.
*Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer.
*Henry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in [[London]].
*Ethel Huxley (1866–1941), married artist [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]] (widower of sister) in 1889.

Huxley's relationship with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day—so long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection:
*&quot;Dearest Jess, You are a badly used young person—you are; and nothing short of that conviction would get a letter out of your still worse used Pater, the bête noir of whose existence is letter-writing. Catch me discussing the Afghan question with you, you little pepper-pot! No, not if I know it...&quot; [goes on nevertheless to give strong opinions of the Afghans, at that time causing plenty of trouble to the [[Indian Empire]]—see [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]]] &quot;There, you plague—ever your affec. Daddy, THH.&quot; (letter Dec 7th 1878, Huxley L 1900)

[[Image:Tom&amp;julien-72.jpg|thumb|left|Huxley with his grandson [[Julian Huxley|Julian]] in 1893]]

Huxley's descendents include children of Leonard Huxley:

*[[Julian Huxley|Sir Julian Huxley]] FRS was the first Director of [[UNESCO]] and a notable evolutionary biologist and humanist.

*[[Aldous Huxley]] was a famous author (''[[Brave New World]]'' 1932, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]'' 1936, ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' 1954).

*[[Andrew Huxley|Sir Andrew Huxley]] OM FRS won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1963. Andrew is the second Huxley to become President of the Royal Society.

Other significant descendents of Huxley, such as Sir [[Crispin Tickell]], are treated in the [[Huxley family]].

====Mental problems in the family====
Biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became &quot;sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind&quot; &lt;ref&gt;letter THH to eldest sister Lizzie 1853 HP 31.21&lt;/ref&gt;, and later died in Barming Asylum; brother George suffered from &quot;extreme mental anxiety&quot; &lt;ref&gt;THH to Lizzie 1858 HP 31.24&lt;/ref&gt; and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James was at 55 &quot;as near mad as any sane man can be&quot; &lt;ref&gt;THH to Lizzie HP 31.44&lt;/ref&gt;; and there is more. His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marion), who became the first wife of artist [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]], was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.&lt;ref&gt;THH to JT 1887 HP 9.164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p175–176&lt;/ref&gt;  
   
[[Image:Marion Collier (née Huxley) by John Collier.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Marion (Mady) Huxley&lt;br&gt;by her husband [[John Collier (artist)|John Collier]]]]

About Huxley himself we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bibby|1972|}} p7&lt;/ref&gt; and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the [[clinical depression|depression]]. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.
   
The next episode we know of in Huxley's life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS ''Rattlesnake'' in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1935}} Chapter 5 'Wanderings of a human soul'&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p27&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p49&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1997|}} p151&lt;/ref&gt; This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate [[bi-polar disorder]]) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.
   
The problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard's sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five more later in life.

==Satires==
Darwin's ideas and Huxley's controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man's place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin's head on a monkey's body is one of the visual clichés of the age. Three or four items of especial ripeness are:

*''Monkeyana'' (Punch vol 40, 18 May 1861). Signed 'Gorilla', this turned out to be by Sir Philip Egerton MP, amateur naturalist, fossil fish collector and — Richard Owen's patron!&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|1994|}} p296&lt;/ref&gt; Last two stanzas:
{{quotation|Next HUXLEY replies&lt;br&gt;That OWEN he lies&lt;br&gt;And garbles his Latin quotation;&lt;br&gt;That his facts are not new,&lt;br&gt;His mistakes not a few,&lt;br&gt;Detrimental to his reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To twice slay the slain&lt;br&gt;By dint of the Brain&lt;br&gt;(Thus HUXLEY concludes his review)&lt;br&gt;Is but labour in vain,&lt;br&gt;unproductive of gain,&lt;br&gt;And so I shall bid you &quot;Adieu&quot;!}}

*''The Gorilla's Dilemma'' (Punch 1862, vol 43 p164). First two lines:
{{quotation|Say am I a man or a brother,&lt;br&gt;Or only an anthropoid ape?}}

*''Report of a sad case recently tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley'' &lt;ref&gt;pamphlet, published by George Pycraft, London 1863; Huxley Papers 79.6&lt;/ref&gt;. Lord Mayor asks whether either side is known to the police:
{{quotation|Policeman X — Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say that the old man never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't think it will be a harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street.}}
:[Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department.]

*''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies, a fairy tale for a land baby]]'' by [[Charles Kingsley]] (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, published in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]'', having &quot;long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|}} [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=303 287]&lt;/ref&gt; and the story includes a [[satire]] on the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], with the main scientific participants appearing, including [[Richard Owen]] and Huxley.

[[Image:Water-babies 2.jpg|thumb|320px|Huxley (right) and Richard Owen inspect a water baby in [[Edward Linley Sambourne]]'s 1881 illustration]]

*In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson [[Julian Huxley|Julian]] saw the illustration by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking:
{{quotation|''Dear Grandpater – Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day? – Your loving Julian.''}}

Huxley wrote back: 
{{quotation|My dear Julian – I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did – There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.}}

'''Interactor''' is a term used to describe a part of an organism with [[evolution]] selection acts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/evolutionweb/eindex.htm|title=the origin and impact of information in the average evolution |date=2002|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactors are the individual evolutionary paths which are subject to real-life interactions, such as [[phenotype]] and the outward traits most affected by [[natural selection]]. In this way the interactor interacts with the environment in a way which creates differential reproduction.

The late 18th and early 19th century was a time of rapid and dramitic changes in ideas about the history of life on earth.]]
{{histOfScience}}
The '''history of [[paleontology]]''' traces the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the [[fossil]] record left behind by living organisms. Paleontology is a field of biology, but its development has been closely tied to [[geology]] and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself. In ancient times [[Xenophanes]] (570-480 BC) wrote about fossil sea shells indicating that land was once under water. During the [[Middle Ages]], fossils were discussed by the Persian naturalist, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in Europe), in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027), which proposed a theory of petrifying fluids that [[Albert of Saxony]] would elaborate on in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031-1095) would propose a theory of climate change based on evidence from petrified bamboo.

In [[early modern Europe]], the systematic study of fossils emerged as an integral part of the changes in [[natural philosophy]] that occurred during the [[Age of Reason]]. The nature of fossils and their relationship to life in the past became better understood during the 17th and 18th centuries, and at the end of the 18th century the work of [[Georges Cuvier]] ended a long running debate about the reality of [[extinction]] and led to the emergence of [[paleontology]], in association with [[comparative anatomy]], as a scientific discipline. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, particularly [[stratigraphy]].

The first half of the 19th century saw geological and paleontological activity become increasingly well organized with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the past history of life on Earth, and progress towards definition of the [[geologic time scale]] largely based on fossil evidence. In 1822 the word &quot;paleontology&quot; was invented by the editor of a French scientific journal to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils. As knowledge of life's past history continued to improve, it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life. This would encourage early evolutionary theories on the [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BucklandGould&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Buckland W &amp; Gould SJ|title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered With Reference to Natural Theology (History of Paleontology)|year=1980|publisher=Ayer Company Publishing|isbn=978-0405127069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding [[evolution]]ary paths, including [[human evolution]], and evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;BucklandGould&quot;/&gt;

The last half of the 19th century saw a tremendous expansion in paleontological activity, especially in [[North America]]. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in [[China]] near the end of the century. The last few decades of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in [[mass extinction]]s and their role in the evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt; Bowler Evolution: The History of an Idea pp. 351-352&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a renewed interest in the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the [[Ediacaran biota]] and developments in [[paleobiology]] extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian.

==Prior to the 17th century==

As early as the 6th century BC, the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] (570-480 BC) recognized that some [[fossil]] shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what was at the time dry land was once under the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;desmond 692-697&quot;&gt;Desmond  p. 692-697.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452-1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1027, the [[Islamic geography|Persian naturalist]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in Europe), proposed an explanation of how the [[Rock (geology)|stoniness]] of [[fossil]]s was caused in ''[[The Book of Healing]]''. He modified an idea of  [[Aristotle]]'s, which explained it in terms of [[vapor]]ous [[exhalation]]s. Ibn Sina modified this into the theory of [[Petrifaction|petrifying]] fluids (''succus lapidificatus''), which was elaborated on by [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]] in the 14th century and was accepted in some form by most [[naturalist]]s by the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Rudwick&gt;Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Sina gave the following explanation for the origin of fossils from the [[petrifaction]] of plants and animals:

{{quote|&quot;If what is said concerning the petrifaction of animals and plants is true, the cause of this (phenomenon) is a powerful mineralizing and petrifying virtue which arises in certain stony spots, or emanates suddenly from the earth during earthquake and subsidences, and petrifies whatever comes into contact with it. As a matter of fact, the petrifaction of the bodies of plants and animals is not more extraordinary than the transformation of waters.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hassani&gt;{{cite web|author=Munim M. Al-Rawi and [[Salim Al-Hassani]]|title=The Contribution of Ibn Sina (Avicenna) to the development of Earth sciences|publisher=FSTC|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/ibnsina.pdf|month=November | year=2002|accessdate=2008-07-01|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Shen Kuo]] ({{lang-zh|沈括}}) ([[1031]] - [[1095]]) of the [[Song Dynasty]] used [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] fossils found in the [[Taihang Mountains]] to infer the existence of [[geology|geological]] [[processes]] of [[geomorphology]] and the shifting of seashores over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]],''Mengxi Bitan'' (梦溪笔谈; ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'') ([[1088]])&lt;/ref&gt; Using his observation of preserved [[petrified]] [[bamboo]]s found underground in [[Yan'an]], [[Shanbei]] region, [[Shaanxi]] province, he argued for a theory of gradual [[climate change]], since Shaanxi was part of a dry climate zone that did not support a habitat for the growth of bamboos.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 3 614&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 3, p. 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a new emphasis on observing, classifying and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. [[Conrad Gesner]] published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important during the course of the 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 9-17&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most 16th century Europeans did not recognize that [[fossil]]s were the remains of living organisms. The etymology of the word fossil comes from the Latin for things having been dug up. As this indicates, the term was applied to wide variety of stone and stone-like objects without regard to whether they might have an organic origin.  Sixteenth century writers such as Gesner and [[Georg Agricola]] were more interested in classifying such objects by their physical and mystical properties than they were in determining the objects' origins.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 23-33 &lt;/ref&gt; Also the natural philosophy of the period encouraged alternative explanations for the origin of fossils. Both the [[Aristotelian]] and [[Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy provided support for the idea that stony objects might grow within the earth to resemble living things. Neoplatonic philosophy maintained that there could be affinities between living and non-living objects that could cause one to resemble the other. The Aristotelian school maintained that the seeds of living organisms could enter the ground and generate objects resembling those organisms.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 33-36 &lt;/ref&gt;

== 17th century ==
[[Image:DelugeScheuzer.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Jakob Scheuchzer]] tried to explain fossils using Biblical floods in his ''Herbarium of the Deluge'' (1709)]]
During the [[Age of Reason]], fundamental changes in natural philosophy were reflected in the analysis of fossils. In 1665 [[Athanasius Kircher]] attributed giant bones to extinct races of giant humans in his ''Mundus subterraneus''. In the same year [[Robert Hooke]] published [[Micrographia]], an illustrated collection of his observations with a microscope. One of these observations was entitled ''Of Petrify'd wood, and other Petrify'd bodies'', which included a comparison between petrified and ordinary wood. He concluded that petrified wood was ordinary wood that had been soaked with &quot;water impregnated with stony and earthy particles&quot;. He then suggested that several kinds of fossil sea shells were formed from ordinary shells by a similar process. He argued against the prevalent view that such objects were &quot;Stones form'd by some extraordinary Plastick virtue latent in the Earth itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hooke Micrographia observation XVII &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Stenoshark.jpg|thumb|left|This illustration from Steno's 1667 paper shows a shark head and its teeth along with a fossil tooth for comparison.]]
In 1667 [[Nicholas Steno]] wrote a paper about a shark head he had dissected. He compared the teeth of the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as ''Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid''. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the [[Biblical flood]] as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp 72-73 &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the considerable influence of ''Forerunner'', naturalists such as [[Martin Lister]] (1638-1712) and [[John Ray]] (1627-1705) continued to question the organic origin of some fossils. They were particularly concerned about objects such as fossil [[Ammonites]], which Hooke claimed were organic in origin, that did not resemble any known living species. This raised the possibility of [[extinction]], which they found difficult to accept for philosophical and theological reasons.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp 61-65 &lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[Image:Cuvier elephant jaw.jpg|thumb|right|This illustration of an Indian elephant jaw and a mammoth jaw is from Cuvier's 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants.]]
In his 1778 work ''Epochs of Nature'' [[Georges Buffon]] referred to fossils, in particular the discovery of fossils of tropical species such as [[elephants]] and [[rhinoceros]] in northern Europe, as evidence for the theory that the earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling.

In 1796 [[Georges Cuvier]] presented a paper on living and fossil elephants comparing skeletal remains of Indian and African [[elephant]]s to fossils of [[mammoths]] and of an animal he would later name [[mastodon]] utilizing [[comparative anatomy]]. He established for the first time that Indian and African elephants were different species, and that mammoths differed from both and must be [[extinct]]. He further concluded that the mastodon was another extinct species that also differed from Indian or African elephants, more so than mammoths. Cuvier made another powerful demonstration of the power of comparative anatomy in paleontology when he presented a second paper in 1796 on a large fossil skeleton from Paraguay, which he named ''[[Megatherium]]'' and identified as a [[giant sloth]] by comparing its skull to those of two living species of tree sloth. Cuvier’s ground-breaking work in paleontology and comparative anatomy lead to the widespread acceptance of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan the dragon seekers pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; It also lead Cuvier to advocate the geological theory of [[catastrophism]] to explain the succession of organisms revealed by the fossil record. He also pointed out that since mammoths and [[wooly rhinoceros]] were not the same species as the elephants and rhinoceros currently living in the tropics, their fossils could not be used as evidence for a cooling earth.
[[Image:Smith fossils3.jpg|thumb|left|This illustration is from William Smith's 1815 work ''Strata by Organized Fossils''.]]
In a pioneering application of [[stratigraphy]], [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], a surveyor and mining engineer, made extensive use of fossils to help correlate rock strata in different locations.   He created the first [[geological map]] of England during the late 1790s and early 1800s. He established the [[principle of faunal succession]], the idea that each strata of sedimentary rock would contain particular types of fossils, and that these would succeed one another in a predictable way even in widely separated geologic formations. At the same time, Cuvier and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], an instructor at the Paris school of mine engineering, used similar methods in an influential study of the geology of the region around Paris.

==19th century before Darwin==
===The age of reptiles===
[[Image:Mantell iguanadon teeth.jpg|thumb|right|This illustration of fossil ''[[Iguanodon]]'' teeth with a modern [[iguana]] jaw for comparison is from Mantell's 1825 paper describing ''Iguanodon''.]]
In 1808, Cuvier identified a fossil found in [[Maastricht]] as a giant marine reptile that he named ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. He also identified, from a drawing, another fossil found in [[Bavaria]] as a flying reptile and named it ''[[Pterodactylus]]''. He speculated that an age of reptiles had preceded the first mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Rudwick ''Georges Cuvier, Fossil Bones and Geological Catastrophes'' p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier's speculation would be supported by a series of finds that would be made in Great Britain over the course of the next two decades. [[Mary Anning]], a professional fossil collector since age 11, collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles from the [[Jurassic]] marine strata at [[Lyme Regis]]. These included the first [[ichthyosaur]] skeleton to be recognized as such, which was collected in 1811, and the first [[plesiosaur]] collected in 1821. Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists [[William Conybeare]], [[Henry De la Beche]] and [[William Buckland]].&lt;ref&gt;McGowan pp. 11-27&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1824, Buckland found and described a lower jaw from [[Jurassic]] deposits from [[Stonesfield]]. He determined that the bone belonged to a carnivorous land-dwelling reptile he called ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. That same year [[Gideon Mantell]] realized that some large teeth he had found in 1822, in [[Cretaceous]] rocks from [[Tilgate, Crawley|Tilgate]], belonged to a giant herbivorous land-dwelling reptile. He called it ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because the teeth resembled those of an [[iguana]]. In 1832 Mantell would find, in Tilgate, a partial skeleton of an armoured reptile he would call [[Hylaeosaurus]]. In 1842 the English anatomist [[Richard Owen]] would create a new order of reptiles, that he called [[Dinosauria]] for ''Megalosaurus'', ''Iguanodon'' and ''Hylaeosaurus''.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan p. 176 &lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Stonsefield mammal.jpg|thumb|left|This illustration of the fossil jaw of the Stonesfield mammal is from Gideon Mantell's 1848 book ''Wonders of Geology''.]]
This evidence that giant reptiles had lived on Earth in the past caused great excitement in scientific circles,&lt;ref&gt;McGowan pp. 70-87&lt;/ref&gt; and even among some segments of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, ''Phascolotherium'', that was found in the same strata as ''Megalosaurus''. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a [[marsupial]], but Buckland later realized it was a primitive [[placental mammal]]. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of a time named &quot;the age of reptiles&quot;, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.&lt;ref&gt; McGowan pp. 78-79 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleobotany and the origin of the word paleontology===
In 1828 [[Alexandre Brongniart]]'s son, the botanist [[Adolphe Brongniart]], published the introduction to a longer work on the history of fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by [[cryptogams]]. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the [[conifers]]. The third period brought emergence of the [[cycads]], and the forth by the development of the [[flowering plants]] (such as the [[dicotyledons]]). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of [[paleobotany]] and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 145-147 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The increasing attention being paid to fossil plants in the first decades of the 19th century also caused a significant change in the terminology for the study of past life. The editor of the influential french scientific journal, ''Journal de Phisique'', a student of Cuvier's named Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blanville, coined the term &quot;paleozoologie&quot; in 1817 to refer to the work Cuvier and others were doing to reconstruct extinct animals from fossil bones. However, Blanville began looking for a term that could refer to the study of both fossil animal and plant remains. After trying some unsuccessful alternatives, he hit on &quot;paleontologie&quot; in 1822. Blanville's term for the study of the living organisms of the past quickly became popular and was anglicized into &quot;paleontology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''Worlds before Adam'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catastrophism, uniformitarianism and the fossil record===
In Cuvier's landmark 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants, he referred to a single catastrophe that destroyed life to be replaced by the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as ''[[Palaeotherium]]'' had lived before the time of the Mammoths, which lead him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 124-125 &lt;/ref&gt; By 1830, a [[scientific community|scientific consensus]] had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 156-157 &lt;/ref&gt; In Great Britain, where [[natural theology]] was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and [[Robert Jameson]] insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the [[Flood geology|biblical flood]]. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 133-136 &lt;/ref&gt;

Partly in response to what he saw as unsound and unscientific speculations by [[William Buckland]] and other practitioners of flood geology, [[Charles Lyell]] advocated the geological theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] in his influential work ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.&lt;ref&gt; McGowan pp. 93-95 &lt;/ref&gt; Lyell amassed evidence, both from his own field research and the work of others, that most geological features could be explained by the slow action of present day forces, such as [[volcanoes|vulcanism]], [[earthquakes]], [[erosion]], and [[sedimentation]] rather than past catastrophic events.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGowan pp. 100-103&quot;&gt;McGowan pp. 100-103&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell also claimed that the apparent evidence for catastrophic changes in the fossil record, and even the appearance of directional succession in the history of life, were illusions caused by imperfections in that record. For instance he argued that the absence of birds and mammals from the earliest fossil strata was merely an imperfection in the fossil record attributable to the fact that marine organisms were more easily fossilized.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGowan pp. 100-103&quot;/&gt; Also Lyell pointed to the Stonesfield mammal as evidence that mammals had not necessarily been preceded by reptiles, and to the fact that certain [[Pleistocene]] strata showed a mixture of extinct and still surviving species, which he said showed that extinction occurred piecemeal rather than as a result of catastrophic events.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 178-184&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell was successful in convincing geologists of the idea that the geological features of the earth were largely due to the action of the same geologic forces that could be observed in the present day, acting over an extended period of time. He was not successful in gaining support for his view of the fossil record, which he believed did not support a theory of directional succession.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan pp. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmutation of species and the fossil record===
{{seealso|Transmutation of species}}

[[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] used fossils in his arguments for his theory of the transmutation of species in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic during the next few decades.&lt;ref&gt; McGowan p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Chambers]] used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex&lt;ref&gt; McGowan pp. 188-191&lt;/ref&gt; These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream.&lt;ref&gt; Larson p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories.&lt;ref&gt; Larson p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Miller]] would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by ''Vestiges''.&lt;ref&gt; Ruckwick ''The Meaning of fossils pp. 206-207&lt;/ref&gt; While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.&lt;ref&gt; Larson p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Owen geologic timescale.jpg|thumb|right|This diagram of the geologic time scale from an 1861 book by [[Richard Owen]] shows the appearance of major animal types.]]

===Geological time scale and the history of life===
Geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Roderick Murchison]] continued, despite disputes such as [[The Great Devonian Controversy]], to make advances in stratigraphy. They described new geological epochs such as the [[Cambrian]], the [[Silurian]], the [[Devonian]], and the [[Permian]]. Increasingly, such progress in stratigraphy depended on the opinions of experts with specialized knowledge of particular types of fossils such as [[William Lonsdale]] (fossil corals), and [[John Lindley]] (fossil plants) who both played a role in the Devonian controversy and its resolution.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Great Devonian Controversy'' p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1840s much of the geologic time scale had been developed. In 1841, [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]] formally divided the geologic column into three major eras, the [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]], based on sharp breaks in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt; Larson pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the three periods of the Mesozoic era and all the periods of the Paleozoic era except the [[Ordovician]].  His definition of the geological time scale is still used today.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' p. 213 &lt;/ref&gt; It remained a relative time scale with no method of assigning any of the periods' absolute dates. It was understood that not only had there been an &quot;age of reptiles&quot; preceding the current &quot;age of mammals&quot;, but there had a time (during the Cambrian and the Silurian) when life had been restricted to the sea, and a time (prior to the Devonian) when invertebrates had been the largest and most complex forms of animal life.

===Expansion and professionalization of geology and paleontology===
This rapid progress in geology and paleontology during the 1830s and 1840s was aided by a growing international network of geologists and fossil specialists whose work was organized and reviewed by an increasing number of geological societies. Many of these geologists and paleontologists were now paid professionals working for universities, museums and government geological surveys. The relatively high level of public support for the earth sciences was due to their cultural impact, and their proven economic value in helping to exploit mineral resources such as coal.&lt;ref&gt; Rudwick ''The Meaning of Fossils'' pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor was the development in the late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors around the world and served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. These disciplines played key roles in the development of a more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the [[French revolution]], and expanded by material seized during French military conquests. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. The English anatomists [[Robert Grant]] and [[Richard Owen]] both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]].&lt;ref&gt; Greene and Depew ''The Philosophy of Biology'' pp. 128-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Bowler and Morus ''Making Modern Science'' pp. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century after Darwin==
===Evolution===
{{seealso|History of evolutionary thought}}
[[Image:SArchaeopteryxBerlin2.jpg|thumb|left|200px| This photo of the second ''Archaeopteryx'' skeleton to be found was taken in 1881 at the Humboldt Museum in Berlin.]]
[[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of the [[Origin of Species]] in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in [[South America]] during the [[voyage of the Beagle]] of [[Glyptodon|giant armadillo]]s, [[giant sloth]]s, and what at the time he thought were [[Macrauchenia|giant llama]]s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times.&lt;ref&gt; Bowler ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of ''Origin'' led to a concerted effort to look for [[transitional fossils]] and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse.&lt;ref&gt;Larson ''Evolution'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861 the first specimen of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by [[Richard Owen]]. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by [[Othniel Marsh]] in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the [[evolution of the horse]] from the small 5-toed ''[[Hyracotherium]]'' of the [[Eocene]] to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus ''Equus''. [[Thomas Huxley]] would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of [[natural selection]] as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] preferred alternatives such as neo-[[Lamarckism]], the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and [[orthogenesis]], an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.&lt;ref&gt; Larson pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Marsh Huxley horse.jpg|thumb|right|200px| This diagram by O.C. Marsh of the evolution of horse feet and teeth over time was reproduced in T.H Huxley's 1876 book, ''Professor Huxley in America''.]]

There was also great interest in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, but at the time it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of [[Java Man]], the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.

===Developments in North America===
A major development in the 2nd half of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 [[Joseph Leidy]] described a ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the [[American Civil War]] that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection.&lt;ref&gt; Everhart ''Oceans of Kansas'' p. 17 &lt;/ref&gt; The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of north America, including the discovery of the [[Western Interior Sea]] that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the [[Cretaceous]], the discovery several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur [[genus|genera]] including ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', and ''[[Triceratops]]''. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, [[Othniel Marsh]], and [[Edward Cope]], which has become known as the [[Bone Wars]].

==Overview of developments in the 20th century==
===Developments in geology===
Two 20th century developments in geology had a big effect on paleontology. The first was the development of [[radiometric dating]], which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the [[geologic timescale]]. The second was the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which helped make sense of the geographical distribution of ancient life.

===Geographical expansion of paleontology===
During the 20th century paleontological exploration intensified everywhere and ceased to be a largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 a total of 170 dinosaur genera were known. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase was due to the examination of new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in [[South America]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt; McGowan p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the century the opening of [[China]] to systematic exploration for fossils has yielded a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals.&lt;ref&gt; Bowler p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinctions===
The 20th century saw a major renewal of interest in [[mass extinction]] events and their effect on the course of the history of life. This was particularly true after 1980 when Luis and Walter Alvarez put forward the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] claiming that an [[impact event]] caused the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]], which killed off the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s along with many other living things. Also in the early 1980s [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] published papers with statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine invertebrates that revealed a pattern (possibly cyclical) of repeated  mass extinctions with significant implications for the evolutionary history of life.

===Evolutionary paths and theory ===
[[Image:Taung child.jpg|thumb|left|Photo shows the fossils of Taung child discovered in South Africa in 1924.]]
Throughout the 20th century new fossil finds continued to contribute to understanding the paths taken by evolution. Examples include major taxonomic transitions such as finds in Greenland, starting in the 1930’s (with more major finds in the 1980’s), of fossils illustrating the evolution of [[tetrapods]] from fish, and fossils in China during the 1990s that shed light on the [[Origin of birds|dinosaur-bird relationship]]. Other events that have attracted considerable attention have included the discovery of a series of fossils in Pakistan that have shed light on [[whale evolution]], and most famously of all a series of finds throughout the 20th century in Africa (starting with [[Taung child]] in 1924) and elsewhere have helped illuminate the course of [[human evolution]]. Increasingly, at the end of the century, the results of paleontology and [[molecular biology]] were being brought together to reveal detailed [[phylogenetic tree]]s.

The results of paleontology have also contributed to the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 [[George Gaylord Simpson]] published ''Tempo and Mode in Evolution'', which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]] rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-[[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]]. This integrated paleontology into the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt; Bowler p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.

===Cambrian explosion===
[[Image:ROM-BurgessShale-CompleteAnomalocarisFossil.png|thumb|right|Photo shows a complete Anomalocaris fossil from the [[Burgess shale]].]]
One area of paleontology that has seen a lot of activity during the 1980’s, 1990’s and beyond is the study of the [[Cambrian explosion]] during which many of the various [[phylum|phyla]] of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known [[Burgess Shale]] Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], and another important site in [[Maotianshan shales|Chengjiang]] China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by [[Harry B. Whittington]], [[Derek Briggs]], [[Simon Conway Morris]] and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, [[Sirius Passet]], in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, [[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1989.

===Pre-Cambrian fossils===
[[Image:Spriggina Floundensi 4.png|thumb|left|Photo shows a [[Spriggina]] fossil from the [[Ediacaran]].]]
Prior to 1950 there was no widely accepted fossil evidence of life before the Cambrian period. When [[Charles Darwin]] wrote ''The Origin of Species'' he acknowledged that the lack of any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against the theory of evolution, but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the future. In the 1860s there were claims of the discovery of pre-Cambrian fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover [[stromatolites]] and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with [[microfossils]] of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the [[Soviet]] scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when [[Martin Glaessner]] would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by [[Reginald Sprigg]] during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the [[Ediacaran biota]] the oldest animals known. By the end of the 20th century [[paleobiology]] had established that the history of life extended back at least 3.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schopf|first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale. 

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book [[Future Shock]], [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like &quot;[[post-industrial society]]&quot; and &quot;[[post-modern industrial]] society&quot; with a similar meaning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionary programming''' is one of the four major [[evolutionary algorithm]] paradigms. 

It was first used by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in 1960 in order to use simulated [[evolution]] as a learning process aiming to generate [[artificial intelligence]]. Fogel used [[finite state machine]]s as predictors and evolved them. 

Currently evolutionary programming is a wide [[evolutionary computing]] dialect with no fixed structure or ([[Genetic representation|representation]]), in contrast with some of the other dialects. It is becoming harder to distinguish from [[Evolution strategy|evolutionary strategies]]. Some of its original variants are  quite similar to the later [[genetic programming]], except that the program structure is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.

Its main variation operator is [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]]; members of the population are viewed as part of a specific species rather than members of the same species therefore each parent generates an offspring, using a (μ + μ) [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|survivor selection]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some organisms tend to exhibit strategies that favor the reproductive success of their relatives, even at a cost to their own survival and/or reproduction. The classic example is a [[eusocial]] insect colony, with sterile females acting as workers to assist their mother in the production of additional offspring. Many evolutionary biologists explain this by the theory of '''kin selection'''. Natural selection should eliminate such behaviors; however, there are many cases, such as, alarm calling in squirrels, helpers at the nest in scrub jays, and sterile worker castes in honey bees, in which these animals cooperate despite an obvious disadvantage to the donor. 

The earliest expressions of the basic concepts were by [[R.A. Fisher]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection |last=Fisher |first=R. A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1930 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. B. S.

Hamilton]] who truly formalized the concept, in works published in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1963 |month= |title=The evolution of altruistic behavior |journal=[[American Naturalist]] |volume=97 |issue= |pages=354–356 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1086/497114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and—most importantly—in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |month= |title=[[The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior]] |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–52 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the actual term &quot;kin selection&quot; may first have been coined by [[John Maynard Smith]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=J. M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1964 |month= |title=Group Selection and Kin Selection |journal=Nature |volume=201 |issue=4924 |pages=1145–1147 |doi=10.1038/2011145a0 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he wrote: 

{{Cquote|These processes I will call kin selection and [[group selection]] respectively. Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton. … By kin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the affected individual, by processes which do not require any discontinuities in the population breeding structure.}}

Kin selection refers to changes in [[gene]] frequency across generations that are driven at least in part by interactions between related individuals, and this forms much of the conceptual basis of the theory of [[social evolution]]. Indeed, some cases of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence one another's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Under [[natural selection]], a gene encoding a [[Trait (biological)|trait]] that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the [[population]]; and conversely, a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated. However, a gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behavior, may nonetheless increase in frequency, because relatives often carry the same gene; this is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour. As such, this is a special case of a more general model, called &quot;[[inclusive fitness]]&quot; (in that inclusive fitness refers simply to gene copies in other individuals, without requiring that they be kin).

==Hamilton's rule==
Formally, such genes should increase in frequency when

:&lt;math&gt;\quad rB &gt; C &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''r'' = the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the actor, often defined as the probability that a gene picked randomly from each at the same [[locus (genetics)|locus]] is identical by descent.
:''B'' = the additional reproductive benefit gained by the recipient of the [[altruistic]] act,
:''C'' = the reproductive cost to the individual of performing the act.

This inequality is known as '''Hamilton's rule''' after [[W. D. Hamilton]] who published, in 1964, the first formal quantitative treatment of kin selection to deal with the [[evolution]] of apparently altruistic acts. Altruistic acts are those that benefit the recipient but harm the actor. The phrase '''Kin selection''', however, was coined by [[John Maynard Smith]].

Originally, the definition for [[relatedness]] (r) in Hamilton's rule was explicitly given as [[Sewall Wright]]'s [[coefficient of relationship]]: the [[probability]] that at a random [[locus (genetics)|locus]], the [[allele]]s there will be [[identical by descent]] (Hamilton 1963, American Naturalist, p. 355). Subsequent authors, including Hamilton, sometimes reformulate this with a [[Regression analysis|regression]], which, unlike probabilities, can be negative, and so it is possible for individuals to be negatively related, which simply means that two individuals can be less genetically alike than two random ones on average (Hamilton 1970, Nature &amp; Grafen 1985 Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology). This has been invoked to explain the evolution of [[Spite|spiteful]] behaviours. Spiteful behavior defines an act (or acts) that results in harm, or loss of fitness, to both the actor and the recipient.

In the 1930s [[J.B.S. Haldane]] had full grasp of the basic quantities and considerations that play a role in kin selection. He famously said that, &quot;I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight [[Cousin chart|cousins]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1999 | title = Psychologically Speaking: A Book of Quotations | chapter = Altruism | editor = Kevin Connolly and Margaret Martlew | pages = 10 | publisher = BPS Books | isbn = 1-85433-302-X}} (see also: [[:wikiquote:J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane's Wikiquote entry]])&lt;/ref&gt; '''Kin altruism''' is the term for altruistic behaviour whose evolution is supposed to have been driven by kin selection.

Haldane's remark alluded to the fact that if an individual loses its life to save two siblings, four nephews, or eight cousins, it is a &quot;fair deal&quot; in evolutionary terms, as siblings are on average 50% identical by descent, nephews 25%, and cousins 12.5% (in a [[diploid]] population that is randomly mating and previously [[inbred|outbred]]). But Haldane also joked that he would truly die only to save more than one identical set of twins or more than two full siblings.

==Mechanisms==
An altruistic case is one where the instigating individual suffers a fitness loss while the receiving individual benefits by a fitness gain. The sacrifice of one individual to help another is an example of [[altruism]].

Hamilton (1964) outlined two ways in which kin selection [[altruism]] could be favoured.

Firstly, if individuals have the capacity to recognize kin ([[kin recognition]]) and to adjust their behaviour on the basis of kinship (kin discrimination), then the average relatedness of the recipients of altruism could be high enough for this to be favoured. Because of the facultative nature of this mechanism, it is generally regarded that kin recognition and discrimination are unimportant except among 'higher' forms of life (although there is some evidence for this mechanism among [[protozoa]]). A special case of the kin recognition/discrimination mechanism is the hypothetical '[[Green-beard effect|green beard']], where a gene for social behaviour also causes a distinctive phenotype that can be recognised by other carriers of the gene. Hamilton's discussion of greenbeard altruism serves as an illustration that relatedness is a matter of genetic similarity and that this similarity is not necessarily caused by genealogical closeness (kinship).

Secondly, even indiscriminate altruism may be favoured in so-called viscous populations, i.e. those characterized by low rates or short ranges of dispersal. Here, social partners are typically genealogically-close kin, and so altruism may be able to flourish even in the absence of kin recognition and kin discrimination faculties. This suggests a rather general explanation for altruism.  Directional selection will always favor those with higher rates of fecundity within a certain population.  Social individuals can often ensure the survival of their own kin by participating in, and following the rules of a group.

It should be noted that these mechanisms explain a relatively high r between interacting individuals.  Absolute genetic similarity is not a measure of r; rather, r shows the “excess” relatedness between an actor and a recipient compared with the relatedness between an actor and a random member of the population.  Thus, in a clonal population with 100% genetic similarity, r = 0 (as strange as that may sound).  This is because there can be no correlation between genetic similarity and interaction strengths if genetic similarity is constant.  This is why it has often been observed that altruism cannot be maintained in a population of randomly interacting individuals (see Michod [1982]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michod |first=R. E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1982 |month= |title=The Theory of Kin Selection |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=13 |issue= |pages=23–55 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.000323 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and references therein).  In such a population, the correlation between genetic similarity and interaction strength is necessarily absent, thus r = 0 and rB &lt; C for any C &gt; 0.  This is why mechanisms such as spatial structure and kin recognition are so important for the long-term stability of altruistic traits, and why measures such as &quot;population-wide average r&quot; are meaningless in the absence of such mechanisms.

==Kin Selection in Evolutionary Psychology==
{{see also|Evolution of morality}}
[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] have attempted to explain prosocial behavior through kin selection by stating that “behaviors that help a genetic relative are favored by natural selection.” Human beings have developed a tendency over time to frame and interpret their actions as an avenue to the survival of their genetic material, making kin selection not a completely altruistic form of prosocial behavior and is perhaps better described as a component of social exchange theory. This theory does not necessarily imply that people “compute” genetic benefit when helping others, but there is an indication that those who behave in such a way are more likely to pass on their genes to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Psychology |last=Aronson |first=W. A. |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2007 |edition=6th |publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0132382458 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Kin selection.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Experiment about Kin Selection]]
[[Eusociality]] (true sociality) is used to describe social systems with three characteristics: one is an overlap in generations between parents and their offspring, two is cooperative brood care, and the third characteristic is specialized castes of nonreproductive individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolutionary Analysis |last=Freeman |first=Scott |authorlink= |coauthors=Herron, Jon C. |year=2007 |edition=4th |publisher=Pearson, Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0132275848 |page=460 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusociality|Social insects]] are an excellent example of organisms that display presumed kin selected traits. The workers of some species are sterile, a trait that would not occur if individual selection was the only process at work. The relatedness coefficient ''r'' is abnormally high between the worker sisters in a colony of Hymenoptera due to [[Haplodiploid sex-determination system|haplodiploidy]], and Hamilton's rule is presumed to be satisfied because the benefits in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] for the workers are believed to exceed the costs in terms of lost reproductive opportunity, though this has never been demonstrated empirically. There are competing hypotheses, as well, which may also explain the evolution of social behavior in such organisms (see [[Eusociality]]).

Alarm calls in ground squirrels are another example. While they may alert others of the same species to danger, they draw attention to the caller and expose it to increased risk of predation. Paul Sherman, of Cornell University, studied the alarm calls of ground squirrels. He observed that they occurred most frequently when the caller had relatives nearby.&lt;ref name=Milius1998&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar study, John Hoogland was able to follow individual males through different stages of life.  He found that the male prairie dogs modified their rate of calling when closer to kin.  These behaviors show that self-sacrifice is directed towards close relatives and that there is an indirect fitness gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman2007&quot; /&gt;

Alan Krakauer of [[University of California, Berkeley]] has studied kin selection in the courtship behavior of wild turkeys. Like a teenager helping her older sister prepare for prom night, a subordinate turkey may help his dominant brother put on an impressive team display that is only of direct benefit to the dominant member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/03/02_turkeys.shtml In the mating game, male wild turkeys benefit even when they do not get the girl], Robert Sanders&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies provide evidence that even certain plants can recognize and respond to kinship ties. Using [[sea rocket]] for her experiments, Susan Dudley at [[McMaster University]] in [[Canada]] compared the growth patterns of unrelated plants sharing a pot to plants from the same clone. She found that unrelated plants competed for soil nutrients by aggressive root growth. This did not occur with sibling plants.&lt;ref name=Smith2007&gt;{{cite journal

In [[human fertilization]], some sperm cells consume their [[acrosome]] prematurely on the surface of the egg cell, facilitating for surrounding, having on average 50% genome similarity, to penetrate the egg cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Natalie |last=Angier |coauthors= |title=Sleek, Fast and Focused: The Cells That Make Dad Dad |curly=y |work=[[New York Times]] |page= |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate= |quote= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12angi.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[wood mouse]] (''{{lang|la|Apodemus sylvaticus}}''), aggregates of spermatozoa form mobile trains, some of the spermatozoa undergo a premature acrosome reactions that correlate to improved mobility of the mobile trains towards the female egg for fertilization. This association is thought to proceed as a result of a &quot;green beard effect&quot; in which the spermatozoa perform a kin-selective altruistic act after identifying genetic similarity with the surrounding spermatozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Harry |authorlink= |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2002 |month= |title=Exceptional sperm cooperation in the wood mouse |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=174–177 |doi=10.1038/nature00832 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionary invasion analysis''', also known as '''adaptive dynamics''', is a set of techniques for studying long-term [[phenotypical]] [[evolution]] developed during the 1990s. It incorporates the concept of [[Frequency dependent selection|frequency dependence]] from [[game theory]] but allows for more realistic ecological descriptions, as the traits vary continuously and gives rise to a non-linear [[invasion fitness]] (the classical [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] concept is not directly applicable to situations with frequency dependence). 

==Introduction and background==

The basic principle of evolution, survival of the fittest, was outlined by the
naturalist Charles Darwin in his 1859 book, ''On the Origin of Species''.  Though controversial at the time, the central ideas remain
virtually unchanged to this date, even though much more is now known
about the biological basis of inheritance. Darwin expressed his
arguments verbally, but many attempts have since then been made to
formalise the theory of evolution. The perhaps most well known are
[[population genetics]] which aim to model the
biological basis of inheritance but usually at the expense of
ecological detail, [[quantitative genetics]] which
incorporates quantitative traits influenced by genes at many loci and
evolutionary game theory which ignores genetic
detail but incorporates a high degree of ecological realism, in
particular that the success of any given strategy depends on the
frequency at which strategies are played in the population, a concept
known as frequency dependence.

Adaptive Dynamics is a set of techniques developed during the 1990s
for understanding the long-term consequences of small mutations in the
traits expressing the phenotype. They link [[population dynamics]] to [[evolutionary dynamics]] and incorporate and generalises the
fundamental idea of frequency dependent selection from game theory.
The number of papers using Adaptive Dynamics techniques is increasing
steadily as Adaptive Dynamics is gaining ground as a versatile tool
for evolutionary modelling.

==Fundamental ideas==

Two fundamental ideas of Adaptive Dynamics are that the resident
population can be assumed to be in a dynamical equilibrium when new
mutants appear, and that the eventual fate of such mutants can be
inferred from their initial growth rate when rare in the environment
consisting of the resident. This rate is known as the invasion
exponent when measured as the initial exponential growth rate of
mutants, and as the basic [[reproductive number]] when it measures
the expected total number of offspring that a mutant individual will
produce in a lifetime. It can be thought of, and is indeed sometimes
also referred to, as the invasion fitness of mutants.  In order to make use
of these ideas we require a mathematical model that explicitly
incorporates the traits undergoing evolutionary change. The model
should describe both the environment and the population dynamics given
the environment, but in many cases the variable part of the
environment consists only of the demography of the current
population. We then determine the invasion exponent, the initial
growth rate of a mutant invading the environment consisting of the
resident. Depending on the model, this can be trivial or very
difficult, but once determined, the Adaptive Dynamics techniques can be
applied independent of the model structure.  

=Monomorphic evolution=

A population consisting of individuals with the same trait is called
monomorphic. If not explicitly stated differently, we will assume that the
trait is a real number, and we will write r and m for the trait
value of the monomorphic resident population and that of an invading
mutant, respectively.

==Invasion exponent and selection gradient==

The invasion exponent &lt;math&gt;S_r(m)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the expected growth
rate of an initially rare mutant in the environment set by the
resident, which simply means the frequency of each phenotype (trait
value) whenever this suffices to infer all other aspects of the
equilibrium environment, such as the demographic composition and the
availability of resources. For each r the invasion exponent can be
thought of as the fitness landscape experienced by an initially rare
mutant. The landscape changes with each successful invasion, as is the case in evolutionary game theory, but
in contrast with the classical view of evolution as an optimisation
process towards ever higher fitness.

We will always assume that the resident is at its demographic
attractor, and as a consequence &lt;math&gt;S_r(r) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all r,
as otherwise the population would grow indefinitely.  

The selection gradient is defined as the slope of the invasion
exponent at &lt;math&gt;m=r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_r'(r)&lt;/math&gt;. If the 
sign of the invasion exponent is positive (negative) mutants with
slightly higher (lower) trait values may successfully invade. This 
follows from the linear approximation 

::&lt;math&gt;S_r(m) \approx S_r'(r) (m - r)&lt;/math&gt;

which holds whenever &lt;math&gt;m \approx r&lt;/math&gt;.

==Pairwise-invasibility plots== 

The invasion exponent represents the fitness landscape as experienced
by a rare mutant. In a large (infinite) population only mutants with
trait values &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;S_r(m)&lt;/math&gt; is positive are able to
successfully invade. The generic outcome of an invasion is that the
mutant replaces the resident, and the fitness landscape as experienced
by a rare mutant changes. To determine the outcome of the resulting
series of invasions pairwise-invasibility plots (PIPs) are often used.
These show for each resident trait value &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; all mutant trait values
&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;S_r(m)&lt;/math&gt; is positive. Note that
&lt;math&gt;S_r(m)&lt;/math&gt; is zero at the diagonal &lt;math&gt;m=r&lt;/math&gt;.  In PIPs the fitness landscapes as
experienced by a rare mutant correspond to
the vertical lines where the resident trait value &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is constant.

==Evolutionarily singular strategies==

The selection gradient &lt;math&gt;S_r'(r)&lt;/math&gt; determines the direction of
evolutionary change. If it is positive (negative) a mutant with a
slightly higher (lower) trait-value will generically invade and
replace the resident. But what will happen if &lt;math&gt;S_r'(r)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes?
Seemingly evolution should come to a halt at such a point. While this
is a possible outcome, the general situation is more complex.  Traits
or strategies &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;S_{r^*}'(r^*)=0&lt;/math&gt;, are known as
'''evolutionarily singular strategies'''. Near such points the fitness
landscape as experienced by a rare mutant is locally `flat'. There are three qualitatively
different ways in which this can occur. First, a degenerate case similar to the qubic where
finite evolutionary steps would lead past the local 'flatness'. Second, a fitness maximum which is known as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS) and which, once established, cannot be invaded by nearby
mutants. Third, a fitness minimum
where disruptive selection will occur and the population branch into
two morphs. This process is known as [[evolutionary branching]]. 
In a pairwise invasibility plot the singular strategies are found where the
boundary of the region of positive invasion fitness intersects the
diagonal. 

Singular strategies can be located and classified once the
selection gradient is known. To locate singular strategies, it is
sufficient to find the points for which the selection gradient
vanishes, i.e. to find &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S'_{r^*}(r^*) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. These can
be classified then using the second derivative test from basic
calculus. If the second derivative evaluated at &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; is negative
(positive) the strategy represents a local fitness maximum (minimum).
Hence, for an evolutionarily stable strategy &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; we have

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r^*}''(r^*) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

If this does not hold the strategy is evolutionarily unstable and,
provided that it also convergence stable, evolutionary branching will
eventually occur. For a singular strategy &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; to be convergence
stable monomorphic populations with slightly lower or slightly higher
trait values must be invadable by mutants with trait values closer to
&lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt;. That this can happen the selection gradient &lt;math&gt;S_r'(r)&lt;/math&gt; in a
neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; must be positive for &lt;math&gt;r &lt; r^*&lt;/math&gt; and negative for
&lt;math&gt;r &gt; r^*&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the slope of &lt;math&gt;S_r'(r)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
at &lt;math&gt;r^*&lt;/math&gt; is negative, or equivalently

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr} S_r'(r)\Big| _{r=r^*} &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The criterion for convergence stability given above can also be
expressed using second derivatives of the invasion exponent, and the
classification can be refined to span more than the simple cases
considered here.

=Polymorphic evolution=

The normal outcome of a successful invasion is that the mutant
replaces the resident. However, other outcomes are also possible; in particular both the resident and the mutant
may persist, and the population then becomes dimorphic. Assuming that a
trait persists in the population if and only if its expected
growth-rate when rare is positive, the condition for coexistence among
two traits &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; is

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r_1} (r_2) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; 

and

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r_2} (r_1) &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; are often referred to as [[morphs]].
Such a pair is a protected dimorphism. The set of all protected
dimorphisms is known as the region of coexistence. Graphically,
the region consists of the overlapping parts when a pair-wise
invasibility plot is mirrored over the diagonal 

==Invasion exponent and selection gradients in polymorphic populations==

The invasion exponent is generalised to dimorphic populations in a
straightforward manner, as the expected growth rate &lt;math&gt;S_{r_1, r_2}(m)&lt;/math&gt;
of a rare mutant in the environment set by the two morphs &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of the local fitness landscape for a mutant close to
&lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; is now given by the selection gradients

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r_1, r_2}'(r_1)&lt;/math&gt; 

and

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r_1, r_2}'(r_2)&lt;/math&gt;

In practise, it is often difficult to determine the dimorphic
selection gradient and invasion exponent analytically, and one often
has to resort to numerical computations.

==Evolutionary branching==

The emergence of protected dimorphism near singular points during the
course of evolution is not unusual, but its significance depends on
whether selection is stabilising or disruptive. In the latter case,
the traits of the two morphs will diverge in a process often referred to 
as evolutionary branching. Geritz 1998 presents a compelling
argument that disruptive selection only occurs near fitness minima. To
understand this heuristically consider a dimorphic population &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; near a singular point. By continuity 

::&lt;math&gt;S_r(m) \approx S_{r_1,r_2}(m)&lt;/math&gt; 

and, since 

::&lt;math&gt;S_{r_1, r_2}(r_1) = S_{r_1, r_2}(r_2) = 0,&lt;/math&gt; 

the
fitness landscape for the dimorphic population must be a perturbation
of that for a monomorphic resident near the singular strategy.

==Trait evolution plots==

Evolution after branching is illustrated using trait evolution
plots. These show the region of coexistence, the direction of
evolutionary change and whether points where points where the
selection gradient vanishes are fitness maxima or minima. Evolution
may well lead the dimorphic population outside the region of
coexistence, in which case one morph is extinct and the population
once again becomes monomorphic.


=Other uses=

Adaptive dynamics effectively combines [[game theory]] and [[population dynamics]]. As such, it can be very useful in investigating how [[evolution]] affects the [[dynamics]] of populations. One interesting finding to come out of this is that individual-level [[adaptation]] can sometimes result in the [[extinction]] of the whole [[population]]/[[species]], a phenomenon known as [[evolutionary suicide]].

Shifting balance theory:
1. A species is divided into subpopulations small enough
that random genetic drift is important
2. Drift in one subpopulation carries it past an
adaptive valley to a new higher adaptive peak
3. This subpopulation has increased fitness. It makes
more offspring, which spread the new adaptation to

'''Social evolution''' is a subdiscipline of [[evolutionary biology]] that is concerned with social behaviours, i.e. those that have fitness consequences for individuals other than the actor. Social behaviours can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient. A behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits, and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss. A behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits, and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss.

This classification was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} He proposes that natural selection favours mutually beneficial or selfish behaviours. Hamilton's insight was to show how [[kin selection]] could explain [[altruism]] and [[spite]].

''[[Social Evolution]]'' is also the title of an important work by [[Benjamin Kidd]].

'''Cosmic evolution''' is the scientific study of universal [[change]].  It is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of [[radiation]], [[matter]], and [[life]] throughout the history of the [[universe]].  While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single broad scientific narrative of a possible [[origin]] and [[evolution]] of all material things, from an inferred [[big bang]] to [[humankind]].  (Closely related subjects include [[The Great Story|epic of evolution]], [[big history]], and [[astrobiology]]).

==  Historical aspects==
The roots of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. [[Indian philosophy]] with sages like [[Yajnavalkya]] introduced cyclic concepts to a world view. Early [[Greek philosophers]] of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things [[change]].  Its modern history began more than a century ago, including the wide insights of [[Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]].  Only in the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of [[galaxies]], [[star]]s, [[planets]], and [[life]]—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution.  [[Harlow Shapley]] communicated the idea to the public at mid-century, and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as part of its more limited astrobiology program.  [[Carl Sagan]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Hubert Reeves]], and Steven Dick, among others, became dedicated proponents of cosmic evolution in its current form writ large, and it now continues to be more intricately formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.  

== The flow of time ==
The [[arrow of time]] provides a convenient archetypical symbol for cosmic evolution.  Seven major epochs are arrayed across 14 billion years of time—a compact collection of salient features of cosmic history from its fiery origins to the here and now.  The arrow captures the sequence of events based on a large body of post-[[Renaissance]] observational and experimental data—a continuous thread of change from [[simplicity]] to [[complexity]], from [[inorganic]] to [[Organic chemistry|organic]], from [[chaos]] in the early universe to [[order]] more recently.  Evolution, broadly considered, has become a powerful unifying factor in all of science, bridging numerous academic disciplines—including [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[anthropology]], among others—thus forging an interdisciplinary scientific story of epic proportions that includes every known class of structured object in our richly endowed universe.

== Thermodynamic issues ==
Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution is the concept of [[energy]] flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, and life forms.  [[Information]] non-equilibrium content is another potential metric to model the subject, though informational bits and bytes might be akin to energy acquired, stored, and expressed within ordered systems.  The observed increase of energy rate density (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of ordered systems is one useful way to address the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[2nd law of thermodynamics|2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]].  As such, material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of [[disorder]].

== Evolution Writ Large ==
Accordingly, biological evolution is a small, albeit important, subset of a more extensive evolutionary scheme stretching across all of [[space]] and all of [[time]].  Nothing entirely [[random]] pertains, as systems are “non-randomly eliminated” as unfit for their environments by dynamically mixing [[chance]] with necessity, or randomness with [[determinism]], thereby deciding the winners and losers throughout [[Nature]] regardless of whether those systems are quarks or quasars, microbes or minds.  Most contemporary researchers consider the term cosmic evolution as all-encompassing, thereby incorporating different types of evolutionary change within and among many temporal epochs:

* '''Cosmic Evolution'''
** '''Eras:''' physical evolution--&gt;biological evolution--&gt;cultural evolution
*** '''Epochs:''' particulate--&gt;galactic--&gt;stellar--&gt;planetary--&gt;chemical--&gt;biological--&gt;cultural.

Although by no means the culmination or pinnacle of the evolutionary process, technologically intelligent humans, as a quintessential expression of cultural evolution, now reflect back upon the profound series of changes that brought us forth.  Considering culture’s possible logical outcome, we may already exist in a postbiological universe—one that has evolved beyond flesh and blood intelligence to artificial intelligence.  Such proposals help to inform the search for [[extraterrestrial life]], asserting the importance of biological and cultural evolution as key elements of cosmic evolution and not separate from it.  Whether humankind is alone in the universe or among many other sentient beings, cosmic evolution remains a viable explanation of our material origins.

== Physical cosmology ==
Some researchers ([[astrophysics|notably astrophysicists]]) restrict their view of cosmic evolution to change within [[star]]s and [[Galaxy|galaxies]], confining the adjective “cosmic” to only astronomical objects during mostly the first several billion years of the [[universe]].  Others ([[Astrobiology|astrobiologists]]) also limit their study of this subject, working among more specialized venues such as [[planet]]s and moons suitable for life during the most recent few billion years. But those who study the entire subject of cosmic evolution in its most general scope over 14 billion years from a presumed creation event (including both astrophysics and astrobiology) address all changes ubiquitously and indefinitely. 

== Controversy ==
This subject can elicit controversy, for several reasons: A creation event like an inferred Big Bang can be hard to accept for non religious adherents. Evolution on the other hand inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious fundamentalists; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which can cause emotion; it challenges age-old ideas about life’s sense of place in the cosmos; it champions change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, which some biologists prefer as their exclusive purview pertinent only to life; it proposes a grand, sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on rationality and empiricism, which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant. 

Some mystics, [[Teilhard de Chardin]] for example (see [[Omega Point]]), have embraced cosmic evolution for religious purposes (both western and eastern), given its highly inclusive big-bang-to-humankind narrative and its spiritual overtones.  However, this is not the intent of main-stream scientific researchers who ply the trade; rather, the effort described herein is a decidedly objective, empirical, and quantitative science driven by naturalists who adhere, liberally and broadly, to the modern scientific method.  Ultimately, if people of all cultures and persuasions find cosmic evolution religiously or philosophically attractive, then all the more intellectually powerful is this transdisciplinary scenario of rich natural history for the new millennium.

'''''Vernanimalcula guizhouena''''' is a fossil believed by some to represent the earliest known member of the [[Bilateria]] ([[animal]]s with [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]]). It is known from deposits dating to {{ma|600|580}}. The fossils are between 0.1 and 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm across (roughly the width of one or two human hairs).   ''Vernanimalcula'' means &quot;small spring animal&quot;, referring to its appearance in the [[fossil]] record at the end of the [[Marinoan]] [[Glaciation]] (see also [[Snowball Earth]]). 

[[Image:vernanimalcula sketch.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]

The ''Vernanimalcula'' fossils were discovered in the [[Doushantuo Formation]] in China. This formation is a ''[[Lagerstätte]]'', one of the rare places where soft body parts and very fine details are preserved in the fossil record. The ''Vernanimalcula'' fossils appear to show [[triploblastic]] structure, a [[body cavity|coelom]], a differentiated [[gut]], a mouth, an [[anus]], and paired external pits that could be [[Sensory system|sense organs]]. 

The description of ''Vernanimalcula'' is not without controversy.  Other workers ([[Stefan Bengtson|Bengtson]] and [[Graham Budd|Budd]]) in the field have claimed that it is largely a [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] artefact generated by growth of phosphate within a spherical object such as an [[acritarch]].&lt;ref name=Bengtson2004&gt;{{cite journal

The appearance of ''Vernanimalcula'' so early in the fossil record has important implications. The radiation of animals into many [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] may have occurred before any animal became much larger than microscopic size. The sudden appearance of many animal phyla in the [[Cambrian Explosion]] may be an illusion. The Cambrian Explosion may instead represent a (geologically) sudden increase in size and the development of easily fossilized body parts by [[species]] in existing phyla.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, J. Y., D.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Models of nucleotide substitution''' are mathematical equations built to predict the probability (or proportion) of [[nucleotide]] change expected in a sequence.

==Jukes and Cantor's one-parameter model==
'''JC69''' is the simplest of the models of nucleotide substitution.&lt;ref name=JC69&gt; {{cite book | author = [[Thomas H. Jukes|Jukes, T.H.]] and Cantor, C.R. | year = 1969 | title = Mammalian protein metabolism | chapter = Evolution of protein molecules| editor = Munro, H.N. (editor) | pages = 21–123 | publisher = Academic Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes that all nucleotides has the same rate (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) of change to any other nucleotides. The probability that any nucleotide &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; remains the same from time 0 to time 1 is; 

:&lt;math&gt;P_{xx(1)} = 1-3\mu&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{xx(t)}&lt;/math&gt; must be read; probability (or proportion, in this case it is equivalent) that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. For the probability that any nucleotide &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes to any other nucleotide &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;P_{xy(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. The probability for time &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt; is; 

:&lt;math&gt;P_{xx(t+1)} = (1-3\mu)P_{xx(t)} +\mu(1-P_{xx(t)}) &lt;/math&gt;

The second part of the equation denotes the probability that the nucleotide was changed from time 0 and 1, but then got back to its initial states on time 2. The model can be rewritten in a differential equation with the solution; 

:&lt;math&gt;P_{xx(t)} = \frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}e^{-4\mu t}&lt;/math&gt;

Or if we want to know the probability of nuleotide &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to change to nucleotide &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{xy(t)} = \frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{4}e^{-4\mu t}&lt;/math&gt;

With time, the probability will approach 0.25 (25%).

==Kimura's two-parameters model==

Mostly known under the name '''K80''', this model was developed by Kimura in 1980 as it became clear that all nucleotides substitutions weren't occurring at an equal rate. Most often, transitions (changes between A and G or C and T) are more common than transversions.&lt;ref name=K80&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Motoo Kimura|Kimura, M.]] |year=1980 |title= A simple method for estimating evolutionary rate of base substitution through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences |journal= Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=16 |pages=111–120 |doi= 10.1007/BF01731581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''flying primates theory''' conjectures that [[megabat]]s, a sub-group of [[Chiroptera]] (also known as [[flying fox]]es), form an evolutionary [[sister group]] of [[Primate]]s. This theory was proposed by Australian neuroscientist [[Jack Pettigrew]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pettigrew JD |year=1986 |title=Flying primates? Megabats have the advanced pathway from eye to midbrain |journal=Science |volume=231 |issue=4743 |pages=1304–1346 |doi=10.1126/science.3945827 | pmid=3945827}}&lt;/ref&gt; after discovering that the connections between the [[retina]] and the [[superior colliculus]] (a region of the [[midbrain]]) in the megabat [[Pteropus]] were organized in the same way found in primates, and different from all other [[mammal]]s. This was followed up by a longer study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pettigrew JD, Jamieson BG, Robson SK, Hall LS, McAnally KI, Cooper HM |year=1989 |title=Phylogenetic relations between microbats, megabats and primates (Mammalia: Chiroptera and Primates) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=325|issues=1229 |pages=489–559 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1989.0102}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which this was supported by the analysis of many other [[brain]] and body characteristics. Pettigrew suggested that flying foxes, [[colugo]]s and primates were all descendants of a same group of early [[arboreal]] mammals. The megabat flight and the colugo [[gliding]] could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground.

The flying primate theory met resistance from many zoologists. Its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related, which reflects earlier ideas (such as the grouping of primates, [[tree shrew]]s, colugos and [[bat]]s under a same [[taxonomic]] group, the [[Superorder]] [[Archonta]]). Rather, many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and [[microbat]]s (or [[echolocating]] bats) formed distinct branches of mammalian [[evolution]], with flight having [[convergent evolution|evolved twice]]. This implication was borne out of the fact that microbats do not resemble primates in any of the neural characteristics studied by Pettigrew, instead resembling primitive mammals such as [[Insectivora]] in these respects. The advanced brain characters demonstrated in Pteropus could not, therefore, be generalized to imply that all bats are similar to primates. More recently, the flying primates hypothesis was rejected when scientists compared the DNA of bats to that of primates. These genetic studies support the monophyly of bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 | year=2001 | month=May | author=Springer, Ms; Teeling, Ec; Madsen, O; Stanhope, Mj; De, Jong, Ww | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation | volume=98 | issue=11 | pages=6241–6 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11353869 | format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation | doi=10.1038/nature06549 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html | accessdate=2008-07-03 | date=[[2008-02-14]] | work=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1105113 | year=2005 | month=January | author=Teeling, Ec; Springer, Ms; Madsen, O; Bates, P; O'Brien, Sj; Murphy, Wj | title=A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record | volume=307 | issue=5709 | pages=580–4 | pmid=15681385 | journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2005 | month=September | author=Eick, Gn; Jacobs, Ds; Matthee, Ca | title=A nuclear DNA phylogenetic perspective on the evolution of echolocation and historical biogeography of extant bats (chiroptera) | volume=22 | issue=9 | pages=1869–86 | pmid=15930153 | journal=Molecular biology and evolution | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15930153 | format=Free full text | doi=10.1093/molbev/msi180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological studies==
Soon after Pettigrew's study, work on another genus of megabat ([[Rousettus]]) disputed the existence of an advanced pattern of connections between the [[retina]] and the [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Thiele A, Vogelsang M, Hoffmann KP |year=1991 |title=Pattern of retinotectal projection in the megachiropteran bat ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal= Journal of Comparative Neurology |doi=10.1002/cne.903140404 |volume=314 |pages=671–683}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion was later criticised on methodological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rosa MG, Schmid LM |year=1994 |title=Topography and extent of visual-field representation in the superior colliculus of the megachiropteran Pteropus |journal=Visual Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1037–1057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have sought further evidence of unique characteristics linking the megabat and primate brains. These studies have had limited success in identifying unique links between megabats and present-day primates, instead concluding that the megabat brain has characteristics that may resemble those likely to have existed in primitive primate brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ichida JM, Rosa MG, Casagrande VA |year=2000 |title=Does the visual system of the flying fox resemble that of primates?

==Biochemical studies==
The implication that bats are [[diphyletic]] has been fiercely disputed by many zoologists, not only based on the unlikelihood that [[wing]]s would have evolved twice in mammals, but also on biochemical studies of molecular evolution, which indicate that bats are [[monophyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mindell DP, Dick CW, Baker RJ |year=1991 |title=Phylogenetic relationships among megabats, microbats, and primates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=88 |issue=22 |pages=10322–10326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.22.10322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Stanhope MJ, Czelusniak J, Si JS, Nickerson J, Goodman M |year=1992 | title=A molecular perspective on mammalian evolution from the gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, with convincing evidence for bat monophyly |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–146 | doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90026-D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have disputed the validity of these conclusions. In particular, it has been argued that phylogenies that are based solely on DNA data can be subject to an artifact named the &quot;base-compositional bias&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hutcheon JM, Kirsch JA, Pettigrew JD | year=1998 |title=Base-compositional biases and the bat problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Neo-Darwinism''' is a term used to describe certain ideas about the mechanisms of [[evolution]] that were developed from [[Charles Darwin]]'s original [[theory]] of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]: while separating them from his hypothesis of [[Pangenesis]] as a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] source of variation involving blending inheritance.&lt;ref name=Kutschera&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kutschera U, Niklas KJ |title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=255–76 |year=2004 |pmid=15241603 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used by [[George Romanes]] in 1895 to refer to the idea that evolution occurs solely through [[natural selection]], as proposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[August Weismann]], in other words, without any mechanism involving the inheritance of acquired characteristics resulting from use or disuse.&lt;ref name=Reif&gt;{{cite journal |author= Reif W-E. Junker T. Hoßfeld U. | title=The synthetic theory of evolution: general problems and the German contribution to the synthesis | journal=Theory in Biosciences |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=41–91(51) |year=2000 |doi=10.1078/1431-7613-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two scientists' complete rejection of [[Lamarckism]] came from Weissmann's [[germ plasm]] theory. Weissman realised that the cells that produce the germ plasm, or [[gametes]] (such as sperm and egg in animals), separate from the [[somatic]] cells that go on to make other body tissues at an early stage in development. Since he could see no obvious means of communication between the two he asserted that the inheritance of acquired characteristics was therefore impossible; a conclusion now known as ''Weismann's barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbieri FD |title=The origin of Metazoa and Weismann's germ line theory |journal=Riv. Biol. |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=61–74 |year=1989 |pmid=2665023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s to the 1930s the term continued to be applied to the [[panselectionism|panselectionist]] school of thought, which argued that natural selection was the main and perhaps sole cause of all evolution.&lt;ref name=anti&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=How to be Anti-Darwinian |accessdate=2007-09-19 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until around 1947 the term was used for the panselectionist followers of [[R. A. Fisher]].

==Modern evolutionary synthesis==
Following the development, from about 1937 to 1950, of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], now generally referred to as the ''synthetic view of evolution'' or the ''modern synthesis'', the term neo-Darwinian has been used by some to refer to modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/modern-synthesis.html |title=The Modern Synthesis of Genetics and Evolution |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such usage has been described as incorrect;&lt;ref name=Pigliucci2007&gt;{{citation | author = Pigliucci, M. | year = 2007 | title = Do We Need An Extended Evolutionary Synthesis? | journal = Evolution | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 2743–2749 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x | url = http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kutschera/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reif/&gt; with [[Ernst Mayr]] writing in 1984:

{{blockquote|&quot;...the term neo-Darwinism for the synthetic theory is wrong, because the term neo-Darwinism was coined by Romanes in 1895 as a designation of Weismann's theory.&quot;'&lt;ref name=Mayr&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr E. |title=What is Darwinism Today? |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |pages=145–156 |year=1984 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0270-8647%281984%291984%3C145%3AWIDT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite this, publications such as the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9373225/neo-Darwinism |title=neo-Darwinism | publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/neo-Darwinism |title=neo-Darwinism |publisher=Hutchinson Encyclopedia |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; use this term to refer to current evolutionary theory. This term is also used in the scientific literature, with the academic publishers Blackwell Publishing referring to &quot;neo-Darwinism as practised today&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Neo-Darwinism.asp |title=A-Z Browser of Evolution |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some figures in the study of evolution like [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,1345,Lecture-on-Neo-Darwinism,Richard-Dawkins |title=Lecture on Neo-Darwinism |publisher=RichardDawkins.net : The Official Richard Dawkins Website |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/gould85.pdf |title=Challenges to Neo-Darwinism and Their Meaning for a Revised View of Human Consciousness |publisher=Cambridge University: The Tanner Lectures on Human Values |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the term in their writings and lectures.

'''Parapatric''' and '''parapatry''' are terms from [[biogeography]], referring to [[organism]]s whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other; they only occur together in the narrow contact zone, if at all. Such organisms are usually closely related (e.g. [[sister species]]), their distribution being the result of '''parapatric speciation'''.

Parapatric speciation is a form of [[speciation]] that occurs due to variations in the [[mating system|mating habits]] of a population within a continuous geographical area. In this model, the parent species lives in a continuous [[habitat]], in contrast with [[allopatric|allopatric speciation]] and [[peripatric speciation]] where subpopulations become geographically isolated. [[Ecological niche|Niche]]s in this habitat can differ along an [[environmental gradient]], hampering [[gene flow]], and thus creating a [[Cline (population genetics)|cline]].

An example&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16639420 &quot;Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of pre-reproductive isolation at a mine boundary.&quot;] Heredity. 2006 Jul;97(1):33-7. Epub 2006 Apr 26. Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; of this is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum]]'', which has been known to undergo parapatric speciation in such cases as [[mining|mine]] contamination of an area. This creates a [[selection pressure]] for [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] to those metals.  [[Flowering]] time generally changes (in an attempt at character displacement&amp;mdash;strong selection against [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]]&amp;mdash;as the hybrids are generally ill-suited to the environment) and often plants will become [[self-pollinating]].

Another example are [[ring species]].

'''Sympatric''' and '''sympatry''' are terms from [[biogeography]], referring to [[organism]]s whose [[Range (biology)|ranges]] overlap or are even identical, so that they occur together at least in some places. If these organisms are closely related (e.g. [[sister species]]), such a distribution may be the result of '''sympatric speciation'''.

Sympatric speciation is the genetic divergence of various populations (from a single parent species) inhabiting the same geographic region, such that those populations become different species.  [[Etymological]]ly, sympatry is derived from the roots sym- (meaning same, alike, similar, or fellow) and -patry (meaning homeland or fatherland).
[[Image:Speciation modes.svg|right|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[peripatric speciation|peripatric]], [[parapatric speciation|parapatric]] and [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]] [[speciation]].]]

Sympatry is one of four theoretical models for the phenomenon of [[speciation]].  In contrast to [[Allopatric speciation|allopatry]], populations undergoing sympatric speciation are not geographically isolated by, for example, a mountain or a river.

Debated almost since the beginning of popular evolutionary thought, sympatric speciation is still a highly contentious issue.  By 1980 the theory was largely unfavourable given the void of empirical evidence available, and more critically the conditions scientists expect to be required.  [[Ernst Mayr]], one of the foremost thinkers on evolution, completely rejected sympatry outright, ushering in a climate of hostility towards the theory.  Since the 1980s, a more progressive{{Fact|date=November 2008}} ideology has been adopted. While still debatable, well documented empirical evidence now exists, and the development of sophisticated theories incorporating multilocus genetics have followed.

At least one recent study provides evidence that sympatric speciation has occurred in Tennessee cave salamanders. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Recent divergence with gene flow in Tennessee cave salamanders (Plethodontidae: Gyrinophilus) inferred from gene genealogies |author= MATTHEW L. NIEMILLER, BENJAMIN M. FITZPATRICK, BRIAN T. MILLER |journal= Molecular Ecology |volume=17 (9)|year=2008|pages=2258–2275  }} [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03750.x  available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of models have been proposed to account for this mode of speciation.  The most popular, which invokes the [[disruptive selection]] model, was first put forward by [[John Maynard Smith]] in 1962. Maynard Smith suggested that [[homozygote|homozygous]] individuals may, under particular environmental conditions, have a greater fitness than those with [[allele]]s [[heterozygote|heterozygous]] for a certain trait.  Under the mechanism of [[natural selection]], therefore, homozygosity would be favoured over heterozygosity, eventually leading to speciation. Sympatric divergence could also result from the [[sexual conflict]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] &quot;La guerre des sexes chez les animaux&quot; Eds O Jacob, Paris, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.

Disruption may also occur in multiple-gene traits. The [[Darwin's Finches|Medium Ground Finch]] (''Geospiza fortis'') is showing gene pool divergence in a population on [[Santa Cruz Island (Galapagos)|Santa Cruz Island]]. Beak morphology conforms to two different size ideals, while intermediate individuals are selected against. Some characteristics (termed [[magic trait]]s) such as beak morphology may drive speciation because they also affect mating signals. In this case, different beak [[phenotype]]s may result in different [[bird call]]s, providing a barrier to exchange between the gene pools. &lt;ref&gt;*{{Harvard reference

''Rhagoletis pomonella'', the [[apple maggot]], may be currently undergoing sympatric or, more precisely, heteropatric (see [[heteropatry]]) speciation.  The apple feeding race of this species appears to have spontaneously emerged from the [[Crataegus| hawthorn]] feeding race in the 1800 - 1850 AD time frame, after apples were first introduced into [[North America]].  The apple feeding race does not now normally feed on [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]s, and the hawthorn feeding race does not now normally feed on apples.  This may be an early step towards the emergence of a new species.

[[Allochrony]] offers some empirical evidence that sympatric speciation has taken place, as many examples exist of recently diverged ([[sister taxon|sister taxa]]) allochronic species.

Sympatric [[speciation]] events are vastly more common in plants, as they are prone to developing multiple [[homologous]] sets of [[chromosomes]], resulting in a condition called [[polyploidy]].  The polyploidal offspring occupy the same environment as the parent plants (hence sympatry), but are reproductively isolated.

A rare example of sympatric speciation in animals is the divergence of &quot;resident&quot; and &quot;transient&quot; [[Orca]] forms in the northeast Pacific&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/erich.hoyt/iWeb/www.erichhoyt.com/More%20Info_files/SC56SM15.pdf Burden et al.: Resident And Transient-Type Killer Wales SC/56/SM15.]&lt;/ref&gt;. Resident and transient orcas inhabit the same waters, but avoid each other and do not interbreed. The two forms hunt different prey species and have different diets, vocal behaviour, and social structures. Some divergences between species could also result from contrasts in microhabitats. The [[polecat]] ''Mustela putorius'' exhibited a rare dark phenotype similar to the European [[mink]] ''Mustela lutreola'' phenotype which is directely influenced by peculiarities of forest brooks&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] &quot;Genetic divergence without spatial isolation in polecat Mustela
putorius populations&quot;. J Evol Biol 14:228-236, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Peripatric''' and '''peripatry''' are terms from [[biogeography]], referring to [[organism]]s whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated by a natural barrier where these organisms do not occur &amp;ndash; for example a wide river or a mountain range. Such organisms are usually closely related (e.g. [[sister species]]), their distribution being the result of '''peripatric speciation'''.

Peripatric speciation is a form of [[speciation]], the formation of new [[species]] through [[evolution]]. In this form, new species are formed in isolated peripheral populations; this is similar to [[allopatric speciation]] in that populations are isolated and prevented from exchanging genes. However, peripatric speciation, unlike allopatric speciation, proposes that one of the populations is much smaller than the other.  

Peripatric speciation was originally proposed by [[Ernst Mayr]], and is related to the [[founder effect]], because small living populations may undergo selection bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Provine WB |title=Ernst Mayr: Genetics and speciation |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/167/3/1041 |journal=Genetics |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=1041–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15280221 |month=Jul |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Genetic drift]] is often proposed to play a significant role in peripatric speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton AR |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 |year=1980 |pmid=6777243 |month=Apr |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Good Natured''''' is a book by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]] on animal behavior and the [[Evolutionary ethics|evolution of ethics]].

==Publishing history==

The book was published in 1996 by [[Harvard University Press]] under the full title '''''Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals'''''. Much of the book details observations of [[primate]] behavior, especially that of [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal 1996, p. 3: &quot;After due attention in this book's first chapter to theories of evolutionary ethics, I will move on to more practical matters. Do animals show behavior that parallels the benevolence as well as the rules and regulations of human moral conduct? … As an ethologist specialized in primatology, I naturally turn most often to the order of animals to which we ourselves belong. … Our ancestors more than likely possessed many of the behavioral tendencies currently found in macaques, baboons, gorillas, chimpanzees, and so on.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On the final page, he concludes:

{{quote|We seem to be reaching a point at which science can wrest morality from the hands of philosophers. That this is already happening—albeit largely at a theoretical level—is evident from recent books by, among others, Richard Alexander, Robert Frank, James Q. Wilson, and Robert Wright. The occasional disagreements within this budding field are far outweighed by the shared belief that evolution needs to be part of any satisfactory explanation of morality. … It takes up space in our heads, it reaches out to fellow human beings, and it is as much a part of what we are as the tendencies that it holds in check.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal 1996, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Merge|moral relativism|Talk:Moral_Zeitgeist|date=August 2008}}
The '''Moral ''Zeitgeist''''' is a term used to describe the progress of modern human [[morality]]. It was introduced by [[Richard Dawkins]] in ''[[The God Delusion]]''. ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is a [[German language|German]] word meaning &quot;the spirit of the age and its society.&quot; Proponents of a Moral ''Zeitgeist'' base their perspective on the view that morality evolved to help our ancestors survive in large groups as social animals. This perspective suggests that moral acceptability is driven by consensus, which in turn is constrained by the demands of genetic survival. As the people's view of what is morally acceptable changes, the moral Zeitgeist is said to &quot;shift&quot;.

From this perspective, the universal consensuses within a society are what makes something morally acceptable, rather than written codes. Dawkins illustrates the changing Moral ''Zeitgeist'' in chapter 7 of his book ''The God Delusion'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slavery, which was taken for granted in the Bible and throughout most of history, was abolished in civilized countries in the nineteenth century. All civilized nations now accept what was widely denied up to the 1920s, that a woman's vote, in an election or on a jury, is the equal of a man's. In today's enlightened societies, women are no longer regarded as property, as they clearly were in biblical times. Any modern legal system would have prosecuted Abraham for child abuse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



==The Moral Zeitgeist and the evolution of morality==
{{see also|Evolution of morality}}
The Changing Moral ''Zeitgeist'' was proposed to describe the continual drift in human morality. The biological evolution of [[altruism]] and morality may be outside the scope of this term.

==Religious morality and the Moral ''Zeitgeist''==
The Moral ''Zeitgeist'' perspective is incompatible with [[Religion|religious]] morality, which suggests that actions are either morally right, acceptable, or wrong based on the religion's teachings or alleged revelations. In fact, versions of religious morality may be seen as attempts to freeze a shifting Moral ''Zeitgeist''.

Dawkins notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There seems to be a steadily shifting standard of what is morally acceptable... Something... has shifted in all of us, and the shift has no connection with religion. If anything, it happens in spite of religion, not because of it.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moral absolutism, which suggests that actions are either morally right, acceptable, or wrong, regardless of the context, may be incompatible with the moral ''Zeitgeist'' depending on whether it is taken to say that actions are morally right, acceptable, or wrong based on the opinions of the masses, which implies incompatibility, or that shifts in the Zeitgeist are shifts in the knowledge of morality, which does not. This latter version of the ''Zeitgeist'' model actually ''implies'' absolutism, though the only known source of moral knowledge is biological instinct.

==Moral realism and the Moral Zeitgeist==

Another view of the moral zeitgeist is that all moral controversy is strictly a matter of factual dispute or pointing out logical flaws in other people's argument. For instance, some people held the empirical premise black people should not be considered humans in an attempt to justify slavery. Once that empirical premise was disproven, and blacks where shown to be just as much humans as other people, that justified equality instead. So slavery is not considered immoral on the moral zeitgeist due to an arbitrary change in popular opinion, but by the refutation of the flawed empirical premise of slavery.

The moral zeitgeist is thus compatible with [[moral realism]], the notion that true moral facts exists. Atheist and secular humanist Richard Carrier, a defender of moral realism, writes

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Thus we can explain all moral controversy and progress. For when we try to argue that someone is wrong about a moral proposition we always find ourselves arguing in either of two ways: either we point out how their understanding of the facts is wrong, or we point out how they have deduced the incorrect values from the actual facts. Both can be valid arguments. For instance, we tell the Nazi that his beliefs, like that Jews are not human beings and that they are plotting to take over the world, are factually false, and therefore his morals regarding the Jews are in error.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Carrier, Richard, &quot;Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism, AuthorHouse, 2005, pp. 336-337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <comment>/* Gene as the unit of selection */  It is _exactly_ half of each parents' genome that's transmitted to each child</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Cleanup-rewrite|Expert needed; Lacks cohesion; sections overlap with other sections.|article|date=May 2009}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:The Selfish Gene3.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' by [[Richard Dawkins]] was a notable early work of [[popular science]] that focused on the gene-centered view of evolution.]] --&gt;

The '''gene-centered view of evolution''', '''gene selection theory''' or '''selfish gene theory''' holds that [[natural selection]] acts through differential survival of competing [[gene]]s, increasing the frequency of those [[allele]]s whose [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] effects successfully promote their own propagation. According to this theory, [[adaptation]]s are the phenotypic effects through which genes achieve their propagation. 

==Introduction==
The gene-centered view of evolution is literally a different way of looking at the same old problem. It turns the whole solution of evolution inside-out for the purpose of examination. What this new perspective reveals is a more easily understood model for the evolution of social characteristics such as racism, deceit and kindness that much of the study of evolution, caught up in the survival of the fittest individual organisms, overlooks.  Moreover, it eases the transition to the [[evolutionary modeling]] of other mediums such as the development of new technologies and the changes in Wikipedia pages, because it describes evolution in terms of the evolution of specific features as opposed to just in terms of the features’ vehicles. 

===Acquired characteristics are not inherited===
Discoveries in science such as the formulation of the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] made it clear that the inheritance of acquired characters was not an evolutionary factor in a physical sense and  identified genes as lasting entities that survive through many generations. Maynard Smith summarized the issue:

{{cquote|If the central dogma is true, and if it is also true that nucleic acids are the only means whereby information is transmitted between generations, this has crucial implications for evolution. It would imply that all evolutionary novelty requires changes in nucleic acids, and that these changes - mutations - are essentially accidental and non-adaptive in nature. Changes elsewhere - in the egg cytoplasm, in materials transmitted through the placenta, in the mother's milk - might alter the development of the child, but, unless the changes were in nucleic acids, they would have no long-term evolutionary effects.|20|20|Maynard Smith, 1998, p.10}}

The rejection of the inheritance of acquired characters combined with the classical mathematical evolutionary biology developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] (particularly in his 1930 book, ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''), [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], they paved the way to the formulation of the '''selfish gene theory'''. An exception to this of course is the advent of society, where adaptations are indeed passed on through generations, and can even influence which members are allowed to prosper and reproduce, eventually effecting change in the genetic makeup of the population. For cases when environment can influence heredity see:- [[Epigenetics]].

==Gene as the unit of selection==
The view of the gene as the [[unit of selection]] was developed mainly in the books ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966), by [[George C. Williams]], and in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), both by [[Richard Dawkins]]. It had earlier been proposed by [[Colin Pittendrigh]] in his 1958 article, ''Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior'', and in the classic papers about altruism of 1963 and 1964 by [[W. D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]].

According to Williams' 1966 book:

{{cquote|The essence of the genetical theory of natural selection is a statistical bias in the relative rates of survival of alternatives (genes, individuals, etc.). The effectiveness of such bias in producing adaptation is contingent on the maintenance of certain quantitative relationships among the operative factors. One necessary condition is that the selected entity must have '''a high degree of permanence and a low rate of endogenous change''', relative to the degree of bias (differences in selection coefficients).|20|20|Williams, 1966, p.22-23}}

Williams argued that &quot;The natural selection of [[phenotype]]s cannot in itself  produce cumulative change, because phenotypes are extremely temporary manifestations.&quot; (Williams, 1966) Each phenotype is the unique product of the interaction between genome and environment. It does not matter how fit and fertile a phenotype is, it will eventually be destroyed and will never be duplicated.

Since 1954, it has been known that [[DNA]] is the main physical substrate to genetic information, and it is capable of high fidelity [[DNA replication|replication]] through many generations. So, a particular sequence of DNA can have a high permanence and a low rate of endogenous change.

In normal sexual reproduction, an entire [[genome]] is the unique combination of father's and mother's chromosomes produced at the moment of fertilization. It is generally destroyed with its organism, because &quot;[[meiosis]] and [[recombination]] destroy genotypes as surely as death.&quot; (Williams, 1966) Only half of it is transmitted to each descendant due to the [[Mendelian inheritance#Mendel.27s law of segregation|independent segregation]].

The gene as an informational entity persists for an evolutionary significant span of time through a lineage of many physical copies.

In his book ''[[River out of Eden]]'', Dawkins coins the phrase ''[[God's utility function]]'' to explain his view on genes as units of selection. He uses this phrase as a synonym of the &quot;[[meaning of life]]&quot; or the &quot;purpose of life&quot;.  By rephrasing the word ''purpose'' in terms of what [[economists]] call a [[utility function]], meaning &quot;that which is maximized&quot;, Dawkins attempts to [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineer]] the purpose in the mind of the Divine Engineer of Nature, or the ''Utility Function of God''.  Finally, Dawkins argues that it is a mistake to assume that an [[ecosystem]] or a [[species]] as a whole exists for a purpose.  He writes that it is incorrect to suppose that individual organisms lead a meaningful life either; in nature, only genes have a utility function – to perpetuate their own existence with indifference to great sufferings inflicted upon the organisms they build, exploit and discard.

===Organisms as Vehicles===
Genes are not naked in the world. They are usually packed together inside a genome, which is itself contained inside an organism. Genes group together into genomes because &quot;genetic replication makes use of energy and substrates that are supplied by the metabolic economy in much greater quantities than would be possible without a genetic division of labour&quot; (Haig, 1997). They build vehicles to promote their mutual interests of jumping into the next generation of vehicles. As Dawkins puts it, organisms are the &quot;[[The Selfish Gene#Crude analogy|survival machine]]s&quot; of genes.

The phenotypic effect of a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so how is it possible to speak of a gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic ''differences'' between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.

&quot;A gene can have multiple phenotypic effects, each of which may be of positive, negative or neutral value. It is the net selective value of a gene's phenotypic effect that determines the fate of the gene&quot; (Cronin, 1991). For instance, a gene can cause its bearer to have greater reproductive success at a young age, but also cause a greater likelihood of death at a later age. If the benefit outweighs the harm, averaged out over the individuals and environments in which the gene happens to occur, then phenotypes containing the gene will generally be positively selected and thus the abundance of that gene in the population will increase.

Even so, it becomes necessary to model the genes in combination with their vehicle as well as in combination with the vehicle’s environment.

==Selfish Gene Theory==
The selfish gene theory of natural selection can be restated as follows:

{{cquote|Genes do not present themselves naked to the scrutiny of natural selection, instead they present their phenotypic effects. (...) Differences in genes give rise to difference in these phenotypic differences. Natural selection acts on the phenotypic differences and thereby on genes. Thus genes come to be represented in successive generations in proportion to the selective value of their phenotypic effects.|20|20|Cronin, 1991, p.60}}

The result is that &quot;the prevalent genes in a sexual population must be those that, as a mean condition, through a large number of genotypes in a large number of situations, have had the most favourable phenotypic effects for their own replication.&quot; (Williams, 1985) In other words, we expect selfish genes, &quot;selfish&quot; meaning that promotes its own survival without necessarily promoting the survival of the organism, group or even species. This theory implicates that [[adaptation]]s are the phenotypic effects of genes to maximize their representation in the future generations. An adaptation is maintained by selection if it promotes genetic survival directly or some subordinate goal that ultimately contributes to successful reproduction.

===Individual altruism, genetic egoism===
The gene is a unit of hereditary information that exists in many physical copies in the world, and which particular physical copy will be replicated and originate new copies does not matter from the gene's point of view. (Williams, 1992) A selfish gene could be favoured by selection by producing altruism among organisms containing it. The idea is summarized as follows:

{{cquote|If a gene copy confers a benefit ''B'' on another vehicle at cost ''C'' to its own vehicle, its costly action is strategically beneficial if ''pB &gt; C'', where p is the probability that a copy of the gene is present in the vehicle that benefits. Actions with substantial costs therefore require significant values of ''p''. Two kinds of factors ensure high values of ''p'': relatedness (kinship) and recognition (green beards).|20|20|Haig, 1997, p. 288}}

A gene in a [[somatic]] cell of an individual may forego replication to promote the transmission of its copies in the germ line cells. It ensures the high value of ''p = 1'' due to their constant contact and their common origin from the [[zygote]].

The [[kin selection]] theory predicts that a gene may promote the recognition of kinship by historical continuity: a mammalian mother learns to identify her own offspring in the act of giving birth; a male preferentially directs resources to the offspring of mothers with whom he has copulated; the other chicks in a nest are siblings; and so on. The expected altruism between kin is calibrated by the value of ''p'', also known as the [[coefficient of relationship|coefficient of relatedness]]. For instance, an individual have a ''p = 1/2'' in relation to his brother, and ''p = 1/8'' to his cousin, so we would expect, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', greater altruism among brothers than among cousins. Geneticist J.B.S. Haldane is famously quoted, &quot;Would I lay down my life to save my brother? No, but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Clark (1968) JBS: THe Life and Work of J.B.S. Haldane ISBN 0340044446&lt;/ref&gt; Don't worry, he was only joking. The slight horror that such a statement invokes suggests that there is something else at work. Examining the human propensity for altruism, kin selection theory seems like a vast underestimate for cross-familiar, cross-racial, and even cross-special acts of kindness. A far more expansive explanation for altruism is rooted in the [[green-beard effect]].

===Green-beard effect===
[[Green-beard effect]]s gained their name from a thought-experiment of [[Richard Dawkins]] (1976), who considered the possibility of a gene that caused its possessors to develop a green beard and to be nice to other green-bearded individuals. Since then, a 'green beard effect' has come to refer to forms of genetic self-recognition in which a gene in one individual might direct benefits to other individuals that possess the gene. 

Such genes are essentially ''especially selfish'', benefiting themselves regardless of the fates of their vehicles.

Note that because the green-beard effect depends on the ability of the individual to recognize the mirrored trait in other individuals, green-beard effects are most prevalent in organisms with sufficiently great intellects. Creatures of great intellect, such as humans, are capable of evolving culturally as well as genetically. Thus, insomuch as culture varies from our genes, the surface changeable adaptations of culture may magnify any underlying genetic green-bearding.

===All kinds of altruism===
====Kindness====	
On the other hand, a single trait, [[group reciprocal kindness]], is capable of explaining the vast majority of altruism that is generally accepted as “good” by modern societies. Imagine a green-bearding behavioral trait whose recognition does not depend on the recognition of some external feature such as beard color, but relies on recognition of the behavior itself. Imagine now that the behavior is altruistic. The success of such a trait in sufficiently intelligent and undeceived organisms is implicit. Moreover, the existence of such a trait predicts a tendency for kindness to unrelated organisms that are apparently kind, even if the organisms are of a completely different species. Moreover, the gene need not be exactly the same, so long as the effect is similar. Multiple versions of the gene—or even [[meme]]—would have virtually the same effect in a sort of [[symbiotic]] green-bearding cycle of altruism.

====Deceit====
Whenever recognition plays a role in evolution, so does deception. Just like the harmless lizard that has evolved a pattern that mimics its poisonous cousin and trick predators, the selfish creature may pretend to be kind by “growing a green beard” whatever that green beard may be. Thus green-bearding and the selfish gene theory also give rise to an explanation for the evolution of lies and deceit, characteristics that do not benefit the population as a whole.

==Intragenomic conflict==
As genes are capable of producing individual altruism, they are capable of producing conflict among genes inside the genome of one individual. This phenomenon was called [[intragenomic conflict]] and arises when one gene promotes its own replication in detriment to other genes in the genome. The classic example is segregation distorter genes that cheat during [[meiosis]] or [[gametogenesis]] and end up in more than half of the functional [[gamete]]s. These genes persist even resulting in reduced [[fertility]]. Egbert Leigh (1971) compared the genome to &quot;a parliament of genes: each acts in its own self-interest, but if its acts hurt the others, they will combine together to suppress it&quot; to explain the relative low occurrence of intragenomic conflict. This may be a confusing explanation as the genes themselves are limited to their natural actions and cannot in general act to suppress problematic genes.  Such explanations may give rise to criticisms of oversimplification. A better description may be the application of [[group selection]] to genomic conflict modeling.

==Challenges to the gene-centric view==
Prominent opponents of this gene-centric view of evolution include evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], biologist and anthropologist [[David Sloan Wilson]] and [[philosopher]] [[Elliot Sober]]. 

Mayr has gone so far as to say &quot;Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/mayr/mayr_print.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Gould has characterized this perspective as confusing book-keeping with [[causality]]. Meanwhile the same criticism can be made of the traditional organism-centric perspectives. Gould views selection as working on many levels, and has called attention to a hierarchical perspective of selection. Gould also called the claims on ''Selfish Gene'' &quot;strict [[adaptationism]],&quot; &quot;ultra-Darwinism,&quot; and &quot;[[fundamentalist|Darwinian fundamentalism]],&quot;  describing them as excessively &quot;[[reductionist]].&quot; He saw the theory as leading to a simplistic &quot;algorithmic&quot; theory of evolution, or even to the re-introduction of a [[teleology|teleological principle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 Darwinian Fundamentalism - The New York Review of Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The gene-centered view of evolution is a synthesis of the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], the [[particulate inheritance theory]] and the [[non-transmission of acquired characters]]. It states that those genes whose phenotypic effects successfully promote their own propagation will be favourably selected in detriment to their competitors. This process produces adaptations for the benefit of [[genes]] that promote the reproductive success of the [[organism]], or of other organisms containing the same gene (kin altruism and green-beard effects), or even only its own propagation in detriment to the other genes of the genome (intragenomic conflict).{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Williams]], other [[biologist]]s and [[philosopher]]s have expanded and refined the selfish gene theory, such as [[John Maynard Smith]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], [[Helena Cronin]], [[David Hull]], [[Philip Kitcher]] and [[Daniel C.

'''''Humani generis''''' is a [[Encyclical#Roman Catholic usage|papal encyclical]] that [[Pope Pius XII]] [[promulgation|promulgated]] on [[12 August]] [[1950]] &quot;concerning some false opinions threatening to undermine the foundations of Catholic Doctrine&quot;. Theological opinions and doctrines known as [[Nouvelle Théologie|''Nouvelle Théologie'']] or [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|neo-modernism]] and their consequences on the Church were its primary subject. [[Evolution]] and its impact on theology, constitute only two out of 44 parts. Yet the position which Pius XII defined in 1950, delinking the creation of [[body]] and [[soul]], has been fully confirmed by [[Pope John Paul II]], who highlighted additional facts supporting the hypothesis of evolution half a century later. It is still accepted Church doctrine.

== The encyclical ==
=== The role of theology ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This deposit of faith our Divine Redeemer has given for authentic interpretation not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Encyclical ''Humani Generis, some false opinions threatening to undermine the foundation of Catholic doctrine'', Vatican City, 1950, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Humani Generis'', Pope Pius held a corporate view of theology. Theologians, employed by the Church, are [[assistants]], to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in all kinds of empirical research, which the Church will generously support, but in matters of [[morality]] and [[religion]], they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, … in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Humani Generis'' is critical of some trends in modern theology but does not mention or attack individual opinions or even groups of dissenting theologians, possibly, because of the much larger, still looming power issue: who teaches authoritatively the [[Catholic faith]], [[bishops]] as successor to the [[Apostles]] or [[theologian]]s, who have constant access to relevant information and research tools.

The Pope later refers to a new [[axiom]], ''a new intellectual current, a new public mood within the Church, and, new behaviour patterns'' of its members. He asked his bishops, to heal this “intellectual infection”, which should not be allowed to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, The Magisterium of the Bishops, May 31, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obstacles to finding God ===

The Church teaches that God can be known with certainty from the created world with human reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', Vatican City, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Pope Pius believes that, in the historical conditions in which he finds himself, man experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone: This is why ''Humani Generis'' begins with a recognition of several obstacles to seek and find [[God]] by the light of [[reason]] alone:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human [[mind]], in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of [[original sin]]. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is why man stands in need of being truthfully enlightened by God's revelation.

=== Four issues ===

Having thus established a main principle, the encyclical continues with a review of the philosophical currents of modern culture and their potential and dangers in light of [[divine revelation]] of faith in the distinct levels. It reviews recent theological, philosophical and scientific developments.

==== Theologie nouvelle ====

In describing erroneous development in the Catholic Church after World War Two, the encyclical does not mention names, nor does it accuse specific persons or organization. The [[Nouvelle Théologie|theologie nouvelle]] in France and its followers in other countries increasingly viewed Catholic teaching as [[relative]]. It departed from traditional [[Thomism]] using relativistic [[historical analysis]] and employing new philosophical axioms, such as [[existentialism]], or [[positivism]]. Theologie nouvelle scholars expressed Catholic [[dogma]] with concepts of modern philosophy, [[immanentism]] or [[idealism]] or existentialism or any other system. Some believed, that the mysteries of faith cannot be expressed by truly adequate concepts but only by approximate and ever changeable notions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 15&quot;&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Pius has some sympathy for the need to update and modernize Church doctrine but within limits:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone is aware that the terminology employed in the schools and even that used by the Teaching Authority of the Church itself is capable of being perfected and polished; and we know also that the Church itself has not always used the same terms in the same way. It is also manifest that the Church cannot be bound to every system of philosophy that has existed for a short space of time. Nevertheless, the things that have been composed through common effort by Catholic teachers over the course of the centuries to bring about some understanding of dogma are certainly not based on any such weak foundation. These things are based on principles and notions deduced from a true knowledge of created things. In the process of deducing, this knowledge, like a star, gave enlightenment to the human mind through the Church. Hence it is not astonishing that some of these notions have not only been used by the [[Ecumenical Councils]], but even sanctioned by them, so that it is wrong to depart from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 15&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pius pleads with the “rebels” not to tear down but to build up. He demands, not to neglect, or to reject, or devalue so many and such great resources which have been conceived, expressed and perfected over the centuries. A new philosophy like existentialism, he says, is a poor and unstable basis for the theology of the Church.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, like a flower of the field in existence, tomorrow outdated and old-fashioned, shaken by the winds of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 15&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Evolutionism ====

In 1950, the encyclical teaches, there is no sufficient basis for a comprehensive belief in [[evolution]], because the facts are still missing. Catholic religion can take [[evolution theory]] into account at some time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This certainly would be praiseworthy in the case of clearly proved facts; but caution must be used when there is rather question of hypotheses, having some sort of scientific foundation, in which the [[doctrine]] contained in [[Sacred Scripture]] or in Tradition is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical took up a nuanced position with regard to evolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter—for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. However this must be done in such a way that the reasons for both opinions, that is, those favorable and those unfavorable to evolution, be weighed and judged with the necessary seriousness, moderation and measure, and provided that all are prepared to submit to the judgment of the Church, to whom Christ has given the mission of interpreting authentically the Sacred Scriptures and of defending the dogmas of faithful. Some however rashly transgress this liberty of discussion, when they act as if the origin of the human body from pre-existing and living matter were already completely certain and proved by the facts which have been discovered up to now and by reasoning on those facts, and as if there were nothing in the sources of divine revelation which demands the greatest moderation and caution in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Polygenism ====

While the factual basis for creationism should be researched further, the encyclical issues a clear no to another scientific opinion popular at the time, [[polygenism]], the scientific hypothesis that mankind descended from a group of original humans (that there were many Adams and Eves.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents. Now it is no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Old Testament critiques ====

A final critique is issued against negative interpretations which downgrade the [[Old Testament]] to historical half-truths. Some Catholic theologians

&lt;blockquote&gt;
place these scriptures on a par with myths or other such things, which are more the product of an extravagant imagination than of that striving for truth. The [[Book of Genesis]] both state the principal truths which are fundamental for our [[salvation]], and also give a popular description of the origin of the human race and the [[chosen people]].&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Humani Generis'' encourages further research, taking into account and respecting the holiness of the [[Old Testament]] scriptures to [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] alike.

=== Conclusion ===

Pope Pius XII, who usually employs diplomatic and carefully measured language in his writings, is convinced of the serious nature of those opinions threatening to (to quote the encyclical's subtitle) &quot;undermine the foundation of Catholic doctrine,&quot; a most unusual tone for this pontiff.

[[Philosophy]] and [[theology]] are the main topics of this encyclical. But it extends further into the realm of [[culture]] and [[science]]. The encyclical is a document with firm distinctions between right and wrong, good and bad. Pius XII is convinced about the indivisibility and timeless nature of [[truth]]. The encyclical is flexible in all areas of scientific research, which do not intrude into, or exclude theology. It demands respect for the intellectual achievements of past generations, which were equally intelligent, but is not afraid to face a future with new questions and improvements. ''Humani Generis'' generated much discussion at its time. It reflects many conservative positions of the Pope, but also his openness to science and new developments. It reflects his belief: &quot;It is the primary duty of a Christian, to convince those who consider themselves modern, that human nature should not be interpreted with systematic pessimism nor with shallow optimism.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let them strive with every force and effort to further the progress of the sciences which they teach; but let them also be careful not to transgress the limits which We have established for the protection of the truth of Catholic faith and doctrine. With regard to new questions, which modern culture and progress have brought to the foreground, let them engage in most careful research, but with the necessary prudence and caution; finally, let them not think, indulging in a false &quot;[[irenism]],&quot; that the dissident and the erring can happily be brought back to the bosom of the Church, if the whole truth found in the Church is not sincerely taught to all without corruption or diminution.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Humani Generis, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''homeobox''' is a [[DNA sequence]] found within [[gene]]s that are involved in the regulation of patterns of development ([[morphogenesis]]) in [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s. 

==Discovery==
They were discovered independently in 1983 by [[Walter Jakob Gehring]] and his colleagues at the [[University of Basel]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Matthew P. Scott]] and Amy Weiner, who were then working with [[Thomas Kaufman]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodomain==
A homeobox is about 180 [[base pair]]s long. It encodes a [[protein]] domain (the [[homeodomain]]) which when expressed (e.g. as protein) can bind [[DNA]]. 

Homeobox genes encode [[transcription factor]]s which typically switch on cascades of other genes. The homeodomain binds DNA in a specific manner. 

However, the specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize only its desired target genes. Most of the time, homeodomain proteins act in the [[promoter region]] of their target genes as complexes with other transcription factors, often also homeodomain proteins. Such complexes have a much higher target specificity than a single homeodomain protein.

==Hox genes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Snake]] --&gt;
{{Main|Hox gene}}
Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the [[Cnidaria]] since before the earliest true [[Bilatera]], making these genes pre-[[Paleozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Ryan |first = Joseph F |coauthors = Maureen E. Mazza, Kevin Pang, David Q. Matus, Andreas D. Baxevanis, Mark Q. Martindale, John R. Finnertyl | title = Pre-Bilaterian Origins of the Hox Cluster and the Hox Code: Evidence from the Sea Anemone, Nematostella vectensis | journal = PLoS ONE | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000153 | year = 2007 | volume = 2 | pages = e153 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000153 | issue = 1 | date = 2007-01| unused_data = |accessdate 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
They are essential metazoan genes as they determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterio-posterior axis. The first vertebrate Hox gene was isolated in Xenopus by Eddy De Robertis and colleagues in 1984, marking the beginning of the young science of [[Evo-devo]] (Carrasco, McGinnis, Gehring and De Robertis, Cell 37, 409-414, 1984).

In vertebrates, the four paralog clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions.  In particular, HoxA and HoxD specify segment identity along the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] axis.

The main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behaviour. They are typically found in an organized cluster.  The linear order of the genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order of the regions they affect as well as the timing in which they are affected.  This phenomenon is called [[colinearity]].  Due to this linear relationship, changes in the gene cluster due to mutations generally result in similar changes in the affected regions.  For example, when one gene is lost the segment becomes a more anterior one, while a gain of function mutation (ectopic) will be more posterior.  Famous examples are [[Antennapedia]] and bithorax in Drosophila. Antennapedia usually functions in parasegments 4 and 5, which produce the leg irnagial discs.

==Diversity==
The homeobox genes were first found in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and have subsequently been identified in many other species, from [[insect]]s to [[reptile]]s and [[mammal]]s. 

Homeobox genes were previously only identified in [[bilateria]]ns but recently, [[cnidaria]]ns have also been found to contain homeobox domains and the &quot;missing link&quot; in the evolution between the two has been identified.

Homeobox genes have even been found in [[fungi]], for example the [[unicellular]] [[yeast]]s, and in plants.

===Plants===

The well known [[homeotic]] genes in plants ([[MADS-box]] genes) are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to Hox genes in animals. Plants and animals do not share the same homeotic genes, and this suggests that homeotic genes arose independently in the early evolution of animals and plants.

===Human genes===
Humans generally contain homeobox genes in four clusters:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''name''' || '''[[chromosome]]''' || '''gene''' 
 |- 
 | HOXA (or sometimes HOX1) - {{Gene|HOXA@}} || [[chromosome 7]] || [[HOXA1]], [[HOXA2]], [[HOXA3]], [[HOXA4]], [[HOXA5]], [[HOXA6]], [[HOXA7]], [[HOXA9]], [[HOXA10]], [[HOXA11]], [[HOXA13]] 
 |- 
 | HOXB - {{Gene|HOXB@}} || [[chromosome 17]] || [[HOXB1]], [[HOXB2]], [[HOXB3]], [[HOXB4]], [[HOXB5]], [[HOXB6]], [[HOXB7]], [[HOXB8]], [[HOXB9]], [[HOXB13]]
 |- 
 | HOXC - {{Gene|HOXC@}} || [[chromosome 12]] || [[HOXC4]], [[HOXC5]], [[HOXC6]], [[HOXC8]], [[HOXC9]], [[HOXC10]], [[HOXC11]], [[HOXC12]], [[HOXC13]] 
 |- 
 | HOXD - {{Gene|HOXD@}}  || [[chromosome 2]] || [[HOXD1]], [[HOXD3]], [[HOXD4]], [[HOXD8]], [[HOXD9]], [[HOXD10]], [[HOXD11]], [[HOXD12]], [[HOXD13]] 
|}

There is also a &quot;distal-less homeobox&quot; family: [[DLX1]], [[DLX2]], [[DLX3]], [[DLX4]], [[DLX]], and [[DLX6]].

&quot;HESX homeobox 1&quot; is also known as [[HESX1]].

[[Short stature homeobox gene]] is also known as [[SHOX]].

==Mutations==
Mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible [[phenotype|phenotypic]] changes.  

Two examples of homeobox mutations in the above-mentioned fruit fly are legs where the antennae should be ([[antennapedia]]), and a second pair of wings.  

Duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the [[evolution]] of segmented animals. 

Interestingly, there is one [[insect]] family, the [[Xyelidae|xyelid sawflies]], in which both the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and mouthparts are remarkably leg-like in structure. This is not uncommon in arthropods as all arthropod appendages are homologous.

==Regulation==
The regulation of Hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. [[Drosophila]] is known to use the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]] and [[Trithorax]] Complexes to maintain the expression of Hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. [[Polycomb-group proteins]] can silence the HOX genes by modulation of [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name= Portoso &gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg|author= Portoso M and Cavalli G|year=2008|chapter=The Role of RNAi and Noncoding RNAs in Polycomb Mediated Control of Gene Expression and Genomic Programming|title=RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg ISBN 978-1-904455-25-7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BLOSUM''' (BLOcks of Amino Acid SUbstitution Matrix&lt;ref&gt;Note that in the [[acronym]] BLOSUM the last 'M' stands for 'matrix' and it is therefore incorrect and unnecessary to write 'BLOSUM matrix', see [[RAS syndrome]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[substitution matrix]] used for [[sequence alignment]] of [[protein]]s. BLOSUM are used to score alignments between evolutionarily divergent protein sequences.  BLOSUM is based on local alignments. BLOSUM was first introduced in a paper by Henikoff and Henikoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date=1992| journal=PNAS | volume=89 | pages=10915–10919|  pmid=1438297 | title = Amino Acid Substitution Matrices from Protein Blocks | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.22.10915 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&amp;pubmedid=1438297 | author = Henikoff, S. | coauthors = Henikoff, J.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They scanned the [[BLOCKS database]] for very conserved regions of protein families (that do not have gaps in the sequence alignment) and then counted the relative frequencies of [[amino acids]] and their substitution probabilities. Then, they calculated a [[odds ratio|log-odds]] score for each of the 210 possible substitutions of the 20 standard amino acids.  All BLOSUM are based on observed alignments; they are not extrapolated from comparisons of closely related proteins like the [[Point accepted mutation|PAM Matrices]].

Several sets of BLOSUM exist using different alignment databases, named with numbers.  BLOSUM with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while BLOSUM with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences.  For example, BLOSUM80 is used for less divergent alignments, and BLOSUM45 is used for more divergent alignments. The matrices were created by merging (clustering) all sequences that were more similar than a given percentage into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences (that were all more divergent than the given percentage value) only; thus reducing the contribution of closely related sequences. The percentage used was appended to the name, giving BLOSUM80 for example where sequences that were more than 80% identical were clustered. 

Scores within a BLOSUM are log-odds scores that measure, in an alignment, the logarithm for the ratio of the likelihood of two amino acids appearing with a biological sense and the likelihood of the same amino acids appearing by chance.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kDFltuQo1dMC&amp;pg=PA673&amp;lpg=PA673&amp;dq=blosum+matrix&amp;source=web&amp;ots=LBo5qtEF60&amp;sig=o-c0PVGPT_HPaPuw_EgTHTPRIEc#PPA697,M1 | title=Handbook of Nature-Inspired And Innovative Computing | isbn=0387405321 | author=Albert Y. Zomaya | date=2006 | publisher=Springer | location=New York, NY}}page 673&lt;/ref&gt; The matrices are based on the minimum percentage identity of the aligned protein sequence used in calculating them.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt; Every possible identity or substitution is assigned a score based on its observed frequences in the alignment of related proteins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/Scoring2.html NIH &quot;Scoring Systems&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; A positive score is given to the more likely substitutions while a negative score is given to the less likely substitutions.  

To calculate a matrix for BLOSUM, the following equation is used: 
&lt;math&gt;S_{ij}= \left( \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)\log{\left( \frac{p_{ij}}{q_i * q_j} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of two amino acids &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; replacing each other in a homologous sequence, and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_j&lt;/math&gt; are the background probabilities of finding the amino acids &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in any protein sequence at random. The factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a scaling factor, set such that the matrix contains easily computable integer values.

It is located in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island in the [[Galapagos Islands]], with satellite offices on Isabela and San Cristóbal islands.  
[[Image:Tortoiseatcdrs.jpg|thumb|Tortoises at the Charles Darwin Research Station]]
== Background ==

In [[Puerto Ayora]], [[Isla Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz Island]], Ecuadorian and foreign scientists work constantly on research and projects for conservation of the Galapagos terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The [[Charles Darwin]] Research Station, established in 1964, has a Natural History Interpretation Centre and also carries out educational projects in support of conservation of the [[Galapagos Islands]].

== Objectives and work ==

The objectives of the CDRS is to conduct scientific research and environmental education for conservation. The Station has a team of over a hundred scientists, educators, volunteers, research students and support staff from all over the world. 

Scientific research and monitoring projects are conducted at the CDRS in conjunction and cooperation its chief partner, the [[Galapagos National Park]] Service (GNPS), which functions as the principal government authority in charge of conservation and natural resource issues in the Galapagos.

The work of the CDRS has as its main objectives:
* To promote, facilitate, design, and implement the scientific investigation necessary for the understanding of biological principles, better understanding of ecosystems, and adequate management of the islands’ natural resources.
* To advise the Ecuadorian authorities on the subject of conservation and management of natural resources in the Galapagos Islands.
* To collaborate with Ecuadorian institutions on the implementation of programs involved in scientific investigation and education on the islands.
* To contribute to the development of scientific and technical personnel from Ecuador who are specialized in natural sciences and natural resource management.
* To contribute and collaborate on educational programs related to the conservation of the islands.
* To compile the results of the scientific investigations and the other activities of the organization and to disseminate this information regionally, nationally, and internationally.
In 2002, the Station was awarded the [[International Cosmos Prize]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''For the alternative non-standard theory see: [[Quantum evolution (alternative)]].''

'''Quantum evolution''' is a component of [[George Gaylord Simpson|George Gaylord Simpson's]] multi-tempoed theory of evolutionary change, responsible for the rapid emergence of higher [[Scientific classification|taxonomic groups]]. According to Simpson, evolutionary rates differ from group to group and even among closely related lineages. These different rates of evolutionary change were designated by Simpson as ''horotelic'' (medium tempo), ''bradytelic'' (slow tempo), and ''tachytelic'' (rapid tempo). Quantum evolution differed from these styles of change in that it involved a drastic shift in the adaptive zones of certain classes of animals. The word &quot;quantum&quot; therefore refers to an &quot;all-or-none reaction,&quot; where transitional forms are particularly unstable, and perished rapidly and completely. Although Quantum evolution may happen at any taxonomic level (1953, 389), it plays a much larger role in &quot;the origin taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes.&quot; (1944, 206)

According to Simpson (1944) quantum evolution relied heavily upon [[Sewall Wright|Sewall Wright's]] theory of [[genetic drift|random genetic drift]]. Simpson believed that major evolutionary transitions would arise when small populations—isolated and limited from gene flow—would fixate upon unusual gene combinations. This &quot;inadaptive phase&quot; (by genetic drift) would then (by natural selection) drive a [[deme (biology)|deme population]] from one stable adaptive peak to another on the [[fitness landscape|adaptive fitness landscape]]. However in his ''Major Features of Evolution'' (1953) Simpson wrote that it was still controversial &quot;whether prospective adaptation as prelude to quantum evolution arises adaptively or inadaptively. It was concluded above that it usually arises adaptively . . . . The precise role of, say, genetic drift in this process thus is largely speculative at present. It may have an essential part or none. It surely is not involved in all cases of quantum evolution, but there is a strong possibility that it is often involved. If or when it is involved, it is an initiating mechanism. Drift can only rarely, and only for lower categories, have completed the transition to a new adaptive zone.&quot; (p. 390) This  preference for adaptive over inadaptive forces lead [[Stephen Jay Gould]] to call attention to the putative &quot;hardening of the Modern Synthesis&quot; in the 1950s, over the pluralism of available mechanisms in the 1930s and 40s.

Simpson considered quantum evolution his crowning achievement, being &quot;perhaps the most important outcome of [my] investigation, but also the most controversial and hypothetical.&quot; (1944, p. 206).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fisher's principle''' explains why the [[sex ratio]] of most species is approximately 1:1.  It was famously outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''&lt;ref name=Fisher30/&gt; (but incorrectly attributed to Fisher as original&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;). Nevertheless, [[A. W. F. Edwards]] has remarked that it is &quot;probably the most celebrated argument in [[evolutionary biology]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Edwards98&gt;Edwards, A.W.F. 1998 Natural Selection and the Sex Ratio: Fisher's Sources ''American Naturalist'' 151: 564-569&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Excepting, we presume, Darwin's arguments which are central to evolutionary theory&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, Fisher couched his argument in terms of [[parental expenditure]], and predicted that parental expenditure on both sexes should be equal.  Sex ratios that are 1:1 are hence known as &quot;Fisherian&quot;, and those that are not 1:1 are &quot;non-Fisherian&quot; or &quot;extraordinary&quot; and occur because they break the assumptions made in Fisher's model.&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;

== Basic explanation ==

[[W.D. Hamilton]] gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on &quot;Extraordinary sex ratios&quot;,&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;Hamilton, W.D. 1967 [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 Extraordinary sex ratios] ''Science'' 156: 477-488&lt;/ref&gt; given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become commoner.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males through-out. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

In modern language, the 1:1 ratio is the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS).&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73&gt;Maynard Smith, J &amp; Price, G.R. 1973 [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v246/n5427/abs/246015a0.html The logic of animal conflict] ''Nature'' 246: 15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parental expenditure ==

Specifically, Fisher frames his argument in terms of [[parental expenditure]].  In Chapter 6 &quot;Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection&quot; under the heading &quot;Natural Selection and the sex-ratio&quot; (p141)&lt;ref name=Fisher30&gt;[[Ronald Fisher|Fisher, R.A.]] 1930 ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;:

:In organisms of all kinds the young are launched upon their careers endowed with a certain amount of biological capital derived from their parents. This varies enormously in amount in different species, but, in all, there has been, before the offspring is able to lead an independent existence, a certain expenditure of nutriment in addition, almost universally, to some expenditure of time or activity, which the parents are induced by their instincts to make for the advantage of their young. Let us consider the reproductive value of these offspring at the moment when this parental expenditure on their behalf has just ceased. If we consider the aggregate of an entire generation of such offspring it is clear that the total reproductive value of the males in this group is exactly equal to the total value of all the females, because each sex must supply half the ancestry of all future generations of the species. From this it follows that the sex ratio will so adjust itself, under the influence of Natural Selection, that the total parental expenditure incurred in respect of children of each sex, shall be equal; for if this were not so and the total expenditure incurred in producing males, for instance, were less than the total expenditure incurred in producing females, then since the total reproductive value of the males is equal to that of the females, it would follow that those parents, the innate tendencies of which caused them to produce males in excess, would, for the same expenditure, produce a greater amount of reproductive value; and in consequence would be the progenitors of a larger fraction of future generations than would parents having a congenital bias towards the production of females.  Selection would thus raise the sex-ratio until the expenditure upon males became equal to that upon females.

== Development of the argument ==

[[A.W.F. Edwards]] has remarked that Fisher's principle is &quot;probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology&quot;&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt; (though this seems debatable; if Darwin's original arguments are arbitrarily excepted from consideration, [[W.D. Hamilton]]'s concept of [[inclusive fitness]] at least rivals it), and has significance beyond merely finding an equilibrium value in the sex ratio.


Fisher's principle is an early example of a model in which genes for greater production of either sex become equalised in the population, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations.


Fisher's principle is rooted in the concept of frequency dependent selection, though Fisher's principle is not frequency dependent selection &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;. Frequency dependent selection is the logic that the probability of an individual being able to breed is dependent on the frequency of the opposite sex in relation to its own sex. It was first described by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in [[The Descent of Man|1871]]. 


Fisher's principle extends frequency dependent to explan how natural selection can act on genes that affect the frequency of an individual's grandchildren without affecting the frequency of their children. Fisher predicted that parents will invest their resources equally between each sex of offspring, because each sex supplies exactly half the genes of all future generations. As a result, those genes that cause parents to invest unequally in the sexes will tend to be deselected. Fisher was aware that in humans, more boys are born, whilst boys are also more likely to die in infancy. As a consequence, he reasoned that because parents tend to invest less in boys - because more boys die before the end of the period of parental care - there is a higher rate of male births to equalise parental investment in each sex. 


Fisher's principle is also the precursor to [[evolutionary game theory]].  [[Robert MacArthur|R.H. MacArthur]] (1965) first suggested applying to sex ratios the language of [[game theory]]&lt;ref name=MacArthur65&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R. H.]] (1965). in: ''Theoretical and mathematical biology'' T. Waterman &amp; H. Horowitz, eds. Blaisdell: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;, and this was subsequently picked up by [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1967) who termed the equilibrium point the &quot;[[unbeatable strategy]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt;.  Hamilton's unbeatable strategy was refined by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]] (1973) into their concept of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], i.e. one which cannot be invaded by a mutant strategy&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73/&gt;

Fisher's concept of parental expenditure (now termed [[parental investment]]), developed particularly by [[Robert Trivers]] is now an important concept in [[ecology]].

==Fisher's sources==
Historical research by [[A.W.F. Edwards]]&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards00&gt;Edwards, A.W.F. 2000 Carl Düsing (1884) on The Regulation of the Sex-Ratio ''Theoretical Population Biology'' 58: 255-257&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the argument is incorrectly attributed to Fisher (the name is in common use and is unlikely to change). [[Charles Darwin]] had originally formulated a similar but somewhat confused argument in the first edition of ''[[The Descent of Man]]''&lt;ref name=Darwin71&gt;Darwin, C.R. 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' 1st ed John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; but withdrew it for the second edition&lt;ref name=Darwin74&gt;Darwin, C.R. 1874 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' 2nd ed John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; -- Fisher only had a copy of the latter, and quotes Darwin in ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''&lt;ref name=Fisher30/&gt;

Specifically, [[Carl Düsing]] of the [[University of Jena]] published this in three works between 1883-1884&lt;ref name=Edwards00/&gt;, and this is essentially identical to Show and Mohler's later model&lt;ref name=ShawMohler53&gt;Shaw, R.F., and J.D. Mohler. 1953. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2458523 The selective significance of the sex ratio]. ''American Naturalist'' 87:337–342.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Further reading==

As &quot;probably the most celebrated argument in [[evolutionary biology]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Edwards98/&gt;, Fisher's principle is a staple of [[popular science]] books on evolution.  For example, see:

The '''mechanisms and processes of evolutionary change''' includes selection (i.e. [[natural selection]] and [[artificial selection]]), [[polyploidy]], [[hybridization]], [[genetic drift]], [[gene flow]], and [[mutation]]. Natural selection favors genes that improve capacity for survival and reproduction. Genetic drift is random change in the frequency of [[allele]]s, caused by the random sampling of a generation's genes during reproduction. Gene flow is the transfer of [[gene]]s within and between populations. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome.

The relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift in a population varies depending on the strength of the selection and the [[effective population size]], which is the number of individuals capable of breeding.&lt;ref name=Whitlock&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitlock M |title=Fixation probability and time in subdivided populations |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=12807795 |journal=Genetics |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=767&amp;ndash;79 |year=2003 |pmid=12807795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection usually predominates in large populations, while genetic drift dominates in small populations. The dominance of genetic drift in small populations can even lead to the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.&lt;ref name=Ohta&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta T |title=Near-neutrality in evolution of genes and gene regulation |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/252626899v1 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=99 |issue=25 |pages=16134&amp;ndash;37 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, changing population size can dramatically influence the course of evolution. [[Population bottleneck]]s, where the population shrinks temporarily and therefore loses genetic variation, result in a more uniform population.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harwood AJ |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond., B, Biol. Sci. |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177&amp;ndash;86 |year=1998 |pmid=9533122 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=9533122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bottlenecks also result from alterations in gene flow such as decreased migration, [[founder effect|expansions into new habitats]], or population subdivision.&lt;ref name=Whitlock/&gt;

The outcome of the above mentioned mechanisms can be seen in form of [[adaptation]], [[speciation]] and [[co-evolution]].  Adaptations are structures or behaviors that enhance a specific function, causing organisms to become better at surviving and reproducing, and speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species. Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species and Co-evolution is the mutual evolutionary influence between two species.

== Basic processes involved ==
The basic theory of evolution has three essential parts.

First, it is possible for the [[DNA]] of an organism to intermittently mutate. A mutation changes the DNA of an organism in a way that affects its [[offspring]], either immediately or several generations down the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpievo&quot;&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/evolution1.htm Basic processes of evolution] HowStuffWorks, Inc. Retrieved on 10-16-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the change brought about by a mutation is either beneficial, harmful or neutral. A very small percentage of all mutations actually have a positive effect. These mutations lead to new versions of proteins that help an organism and its future generations better adapt to changes in their environment. For example, a specific 32 [[base pair]] deletion in human [[CCR5]] ([[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|CCR5-Δ32]]) confers [[HIV]] resistance to [[Zygosity|homozygotes]] and delays [[AIDS]] onset in [[Zygosity|heterozygotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/hugenet/factsheets/FS_CCR5.htm|title=CCR5 receptor gene and HIV infection, Antonio Pacheco.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''neutral mutation'' is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid [[codon]] (presumably within an [[mRNA]] molecule) which results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, [[amino acid]]. Changes in DNA caused by mutation can cause errors in [[protein]] sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. To function correctly, each cell depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a [[genetic disorder]]. However, only a small percentage of mutations cause genetic disorders; most have no impact on health. The process of selecting bad mutations and spreading good mutations is called natural selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpievo&quot;/&gt;

Third, as mutations occur and spread over long periods of time, they cause new species to form. Over the course of many millions of years, the processes of mutation and [[natural selection]] have created every biological individual that exists in the world today, from the simplest [[microorganism]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], to multicellular organisms such as plants and animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpievo&quot;/&gt;
 
Before the process of [[evolution]] began, it is thought that billions of years ago, chemicals organized themselves into a self-replicating molecule.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpievo&quot;/&gt; This spark of life was the seed of every living thing that used to exist or which exists today. That simplest life form, through the processes of mutation and natural selection, was then shaped into every living species on the planet.

===Mutation===
{{details more|Mutation|Molecular evolution}}
Genetic variation comes from [[randomness|random]] mutations that occur in the genomes of organisms. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are caused by [[Radioactive decay|radiation]], [[virus]]es, [[transposon]]s and [[mutagen|mutagenic chemicals]], as well as errors that occur during [[meiosis]] or [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertram J |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=Mol.

=== Polyploidy ===
{{Main|Polyploidy}}
Polyploidy is the condition of some [[biological cell]]s and [[organism]]s manifested by the presence of more than two [[Homologous Chromosomes|homologous]] sets of [[chromosomes]]. Polyploid types are termed according to the number of chromosome sets in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]: ''triploid'' (three sets; 3x), ''tetraploid'' (four sets; 4x), ''pentaploid'' (five sets; 5x), ''hexaploid'' (six sets; 6x) and so on.  

A haploid has only one set of chromosomes. [[Haploidy]] may also occur as a normal stage in an organism's life cycle as in ferns and fungi. In some instances not all the chromosomes are duplicated and the condition is called [[aneuploidy]].  Where an organism is normally [[diploid]], some spontaneous aberrations may occur which are usually caused by a hampered [[cell division]]. 

Polyploidy occurs in some [[animal]]s, such as [[goldfish]], [[salmon]], and [[salamander]]s, but is especially common among [[fern]]s and flowering [[plant]]s, including both wild and cultivated [[species]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tateja&quot;&gt;Tate, J.A., Soltis, D.E., &amp; Soltis, P.S. (2005). Polyploidy in plants. In The Evolution of the Genome (edited by T.R. Gregory). Elsevier, San Diego, pp.371-426.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wheat]], for example, after millennia of [[hybrid]]ization and modification by humans, has strains that are ''diploid'' (two sets of chromosomes), ''tetraploid'' (four sets of chromosomes) with the common name of [[durum]] or [[macaroni]] wheat, and ''hexaploid'' (six sets of chromosomes) with the common name of bread wheat.&lt;ref name=&quot;tateja&quot;/&gt; Many agriculturally important plants of the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' are also tetraploids; their relationship is described by the [[Triangle of U]].
The occurrence of polyploidy is a mechanism of speciation and is known to have resulted in new species of the plant [[Salsify]] (also known as &quot;goatsbeard&quot;).

Examples in animals are more common in the ‘lower’ forms such as [[flatworm]]s, [[leech]]es, and [[brine shrimp]]. Polyploid animals are often sterile, so they often reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]]. Polyploid salamanders and lizards are also quite common and parthenogenetic. While mammalian liver cells are polyploid, rare instances of polyploid [[mammals]] are known, but most often result in [[prenatal]] death. 

There are large number of polyploid crop varieties.
There are few naturally occurring polyploid [[conifers]]. One example is the giant [[tree]] ''[[Sequoia|Sequoia sempervirens]]'' or [[Sequoia|Coast Redwood]] which is a hexaploid (6x) with 66 chromosomes (2n=6x=66), although the origin is unclear &lt;ref&gt;Ahuja MR, Neale DB. &quot;Origins of Polyploidy in Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. DON) ENDL.)
and Relationship of Coast Redwood to other Genera of Taxodiaceae&quot; '' 
Silvae Genetica 51, 2–3 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;.
The induction of polyploids is a common technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, [[Triticale]] is the hybrid of wheat (''Triticum turgidum'') and [[rye]] (''Secale cereale''). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become triticale.
In some situations polyploid crops are preferred because they are sterile. For example many seedless fruit varieties are seedless as a result of polyploidy. Such crops are propagated using asexual techniques such as grafting.

=== Hybridization ===
{{Main|Hybrid}}
Hybridization is the result of interbreeding between two animals or plants of different [[Taxon|taxa]].
Hybridization between two closely related species is actually a common occurrence in nature. Many [[hybrid zone]]s are known where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers. These hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying the mechanisms of [[speciation]] ([[Hybrid speciation]]). Recently DNA analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in the [[North West Territories]] confirmed the existence of naturally occurring and fertile [[polar bear]]-[[grizzly bear]] hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4766217.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2006-05-13]]|title=Hybrid bear shot dead in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some species, hybridization plays an important role in evolutionary biology. While most hybrids are disadvantaged as a result of genetic incompatibility, the fittest survive, regardless of species boundaries.  They may have a beneficial combination of traits allowing them to exploit new habitats or to succeed in a marginal habitat where the two parent species are disadvantaged.  This has been seen in experiments on [[sunflower]] species. Unlike mutation, which affects only one gene, hybridization creates multiple variations across genes or [[gene]] [[combination]]s simultaneously. Successful hybrids could evolve into new species within 50-60 generations. This leads some scientists to speculate that life is a genetic continuum rather than a series of self-contained species.

[[Image:Trilliumhybrid2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A sterile Trillium hybrid between ''[[Trillium cernuum]]'' and ''[[Trillium grandiflorum]]'']]
Plant species hybridize more readily than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are more often fertile hybrids and may reproduce, though there still exist sterile hybrids and selective hybrid elimination where the offspring are less able to survive and are thus eliminated before they can reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;hybrid&quot;&gt; Wricke, Gunter, and Eberhard Weber. 1986. Quantitative genetics and selection in plant breeding. Berlin: W. de Gruyte&lt;/ref&gt; A number of plant species are the result of hybridization and [[polyploidy]] with many plant species easily cross pollinating and producing viable seeds, the distinction between each species is often maintained by geographical isolation or differences in the flowering period. Animals, being more mobile, have developed complex mating behaviors that maintain the species boundary and when hybrids do occur, natural selection tends to weed them out of the population since these hybrids generally can not find mates that will accept them or they are less adapted and fit for survival in their habitats.  Since plants hybridize frequently without much work, they are often created by humans in order to produce improved plants.  These improvements can include the production of more or improved; seeds, fruits or other plant parts for consumption, or to make a plant more winter or heat hardy or improve its growth and/or appearance for use in horticulture. Much work is now being done with hybrids to produce more disease resistant plants for both agricultural and [[horticulture|horticultural]] crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;hybrid&quot;/&gt;  In many groups of plants hybridization has been used to produce larger and more showy flowers and new flower colors.

==Genetic change in populations==

=== Natural selection ===
[[Image:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]
{{details more|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}

[[Natural selection]] is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become, and remain, more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a &quot;self-evident&quot; mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
:* Heritable variation exists within populations of organisms.
:* Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
:* These offspring vary in their ability to survive and reproduce.

These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors pass these advantageous traits on, while traits that do not confer an advantage are not passed on to the next generation.

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism. This measures the organism's genetic contribution to the next generation. However, this is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness measures the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haldane J |title=The theory of natural selection today |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4663 |pages=710&amp;ndash;13 |year=1959 |pmid=13644170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, if an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be &quot;selected ''for''&quot;. Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival, and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer&amp;mdash;they are &quot;selected ''against''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lande&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lande R, Arnold SJ |year=1983 |title=The measurement of selection on correlated characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |pages=1210&amp;ndash;26} |doi=10.2307/2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic, if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |year=2005 |title=Evolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0-87893-187-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorized into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=11470913 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=9157&amp;ndash;60 |year=2001 |pmid=11470913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, [[disruptive selection]] is selection for extreme trait values and often results in [[bimodal distribution|two different values]] becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilizing selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=17248980 |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773&amp;ndash;95 |year=1979 |pmid=17248980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

[[Image:Pfau imponierend.jpg|260px|left|thumb|An example of koinophilia: the female [[peahen]] chose to mate with the male [[peacock]] who had the most beautiful plumage in her mind (intersexual selection).]]
A special case of natural selection is [[sexual selection]], which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andersson M, Simmons L |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends Ecol. Evol. (Amst.) |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296&amp;ndash;302 |year=2006 |pmid=16769428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent in males of some animal species, despite traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls or bright colors that attract predators, decreasing the survival of individual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kokko H, Brooks R, McNamara J, Houston A |title=The sexual selection continuum |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1691039&amp;blobtype=pdf |journal=Proc.

=== Artificial selection ===
{{Main|Artificial selection}}
Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of certain traits, or combinations of traits, over others.&lt;ref name=&quot;artisel&quot;&gt;[http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/essential/life/session5/closer1.html Artificial selection] Annenberg Media, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
It was originally defined by [[Charles Darwin]] in contrast to the process of [[natural selection]], in which the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits is attributed to improved survival and reproductive ability in the natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] of the organism. Artificial selection that produces an undesirable outcome from a human perspective is sometimes called ''negative selection'' (but note that this term has a better-established meaning as a type of natural selection; see [[negative selection]]).  Artificial selection can also be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_940/powerpoints/ArtificialSelection.ppt Artificial Selection powerpoint, University of Wisconsin-Madison]&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between natural and artificial selection centers on the difference in environment among organisms subject to the two processes. Essentially, in artificial selection, the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], which is the amount of offspring an individual contributes to a population relative to other individuals in that same population of an organism, is defined in part by its display of the traits being selected for by human beings. Because humans either intentionally or unintentionally exert control over which organisms in a population reproduce or how many offspring they produce, the distribution of traits in the organisms' population will change. 

It should be emphasized that there is no real difference in the genetic processes underlying artificial and natural selection, and that the concept of artificial selection was first introduced as an illustration of the wider process of natural selection. The selection process is termed &quot;artificial&quot; when human preferences or influences have a significant effect on the evolution of a particular population or species. Indeed, many evolutionary biologists view [[domestication]] as a type of natural selection and adaptive change that occurs as organisms are brought under the control of human beings.

Studies in [[evolutionary physiology]], [[behavioral genetics]], and other areas of organismal biology have also made use of deliberate artificial selection, though longer [[generation time]]s and greater difficulty in breeding can make such projects challenging in vertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swallow&quot;&gt;Swallow JG, Garland T.

===Gene flow===

[[Image:Lion waiting in Nambia.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Male [[lion]]s leave the pride where they are born and take over a new pride to mate. This results in [[gene flow]] between prides.]]

[[Gene flow]] is the exchange of genes between populations, which are usually of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morjan C, Rieseberg L |title=How species evolve collectively: implications of gene flow and selection for the spread of advantageous alleles |journal=Mol. Ecol. |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1341&amp;ndash;56 |year=2004 |pmid=15140081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms, or the exchange of [[pollen]]. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]].

Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies. Immigration may add new genetic material to the established [[gene pool]] of a population. Conversely, emigration may remove genetic material. As [[reproductive isolation|barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]], gene flow may slow this process by spreading genetic differences between the populations. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the flow of plant genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Su H, Qu L, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H |title=The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? |journal=Heredity |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=212&amp;ndash;19 |year=2003 |pmid=12634804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic drift===

[[Image:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|left|250px|Simulation of [[genetic drift]] of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top) and 100 (bottom). Drift is more rapid in the smaller population.]]
Genetic drift is the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles in the offspring generation are a [[sampling (statistics)|random sample]] of those in the parent generation, and are thus subject to [[sampling error]].&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt; As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to &quot;drift&quot; upward or downward in a [[random walk]]. This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]], either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone, and two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure can drift apart by random fluctuation into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lande R |title=Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal=Genome |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=221&amp;ndash;27 |year=1989 |pmid=2687093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time for an allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Otto S, Whitlock M |title=The probability of fixation in populations of changing size |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=9178020 |journal=Genetics |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=723&amp;ndash;33 |year=1997 |pmid=9178020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although natural selection is responsible for adaptation, the relative importance of the two forces of natural selection and genetic drift in driving evolutionary change in general is an area of current research in evolutionary biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nei M |title=Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/22/12/2318 |journal=Mol.

==Evolutionary processes==

=== Adaptation ===
{{main|Adaptation}}

Adaptations are structures or behaviors that enhance a specific function, causing organisms to become better at surviving and reproducing.&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species |place=London |publisher=John Murray |edition=1st |pages=p. 1 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=16}}. Related earlier ideas were acknowledged in {{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year=1861 |title=On the Origin of Species |place=London |publisher=John Murray |edition=3rd |pages=p. xiii |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are produced by a combination of the continuous production of small, random changes in traits, followed by natural selection of the variants best-suited for their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orr H |title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15716908}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to [[antibiotic]] selection, with mutations causing [[antibiotic resistance]] by either modifying the target of the drug, or removing the transporters that allow the drug into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nakajima A, Sugimoto Y, Yoneyama H, Nakae T |title=High-level fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to interplay of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and the DNA gyrase mutation |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mandi/46/6/46_391/_article/-char/en |journal=Microbiol. Immunol. |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=391–95 |year=2002 |pmid=12153116}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact [[exaptation]]s: structures originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process.&lt;ref name=GouldStructP1235&gt;{{wikiref |id=Gould-2002 |text=Gould 2002, pp. 1235–1236}} &lt;/ref&gt; One example is the African lizard ''Holapsis guentheri'', which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree&amp;mdash;an exaptation.&lt;ref name=GouldStructP1235/&gt;

Dev. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=445-58 |year=2002 |pmid=12492145}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures, structures with similar internal organization may have very different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are structurally similar to both human hands and seal flippers, due to the common descent of these structures from an ancestor that also had five digits at the end of each forelimb. Other idiosyncratic anatomical features, such as [[sesamoid bone|bones in the wrist]] of the [[panda]] being formed into a false &quot;thumb,&quot; indicate that an organism's evolutionary lineage can limit what adaptations are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salesa MJ, Antón M, Peigné S, Morales J |title=Evidence of a false thumb in a fossil carnivore clarifies the evolution of pandas |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/2/379 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.]] |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=379–82 |year=2006 |pmid=16387860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During adaption, some structures may lose their original function and become [[vestigial structure]]s.&lt;ref name=Fong&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fong D, Kane T, Culver D |title=Vestigialization and Loss of Nonfunctional Characters |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0066-4162%281995%2926%3C249%3AVALONC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2 |journal=Ann.

=== Speciation ===
{{Main|Speciation}}
[[Image:Speciation modes edit.svg|right|thumb|300px|The four mechanisms of [[speciation]].]]
[[Speciation]] is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gavrilets S |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–215 |year=2003 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jiggins CD, Bridle JR |title=Speciation in the apple maggot fly: a blend of vintages? |journal=Trends Ecol. Evol. (Amst.) |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=111–4 |year=2004 |pmid=16701238}}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite web|author=Boxhorn, J|date=1995|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html|title=Observed Instances of Speciation|publisher=The TalkOrigins Archive|accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Weinberg JR, Starczak VR, Jorg, D |title=Evidence for Rapid Speciation Following a Founder Event in the Laboratory |journal=Evolution |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=1214–20 |year=1992 |doi=10.2307/2409766}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sexually-reproducing organisms, speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence. There are four mechanisms for speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. As selection and drift act independently in isolated populations, separation will eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoskin CJ, Higgle M, McDonald KR, Moritz C |date=2005 |title=Reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation |journal=Nature |volume=437 |pages =1353–356|doi=10.1038/nature04004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation through both rapid genetic drift and selection on a small gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton AR |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 |year=1980 |pmid=6777243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets/&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localized metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Antonovics J |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |year=2006 |pmid=16639420 |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produces a change in flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, causing reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nosil P, Crespi B, Gries R, Gries G |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–27 |year=2007 |pmid=16900317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Darwin's finches cropped.jpeg|frame|left|[[Geographical isolation]] of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] on the [[Galápagos Islands]] produced over a dozen new species.]]

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of [[gene flow]] may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savolainen V, Anstett M-C, Lexer C, Hutton I, Clarkson JJ, Norup MV, Powell MP, Springate D, Salamin N, Baker WJr |date=2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |volume=441 |pages=210–13 | pmid=16467788}}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal| author=Barluenga M, Stölting KN, Salzburger W, Muschick M, Meyer A |date=2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish |journal=Nature |volume=439 |pages=719–723 |pmid=16467837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic differences]] and [[assortative mating|non-random mating]], to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gavrilets S |title=The Maynard Smith model of sympatric speciation |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=239 |issue=2 |pages=172–82 |year=2006 |pmid=16242727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new [[hybrid]] species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile, because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent, being from different species cannot successfully pair. It is more common in plants, however because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]]. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form a matching pair during meiosis, as each parent's chromosomes is represented by a pair already.&lt;ref&gt;Belderok, Bob &amp; Hans Mesdag &amp; Dingena A. Donner. (2000) ''Bread-Making Quality of Wheat''. Springer. p.3. ISBN 0-7923-6383-3.&lt;br /&gt;*Hancock, James F. (2004) ''Planti Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species''. CABI Publishing. ISBN 0-85199-685-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, chromosome doubling can itself cause reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albertin W, Brabant P, Catrice O, Eber F, Jenczewski E, Chèvre AM, Thiellement H |title=Autopolyploidy in cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) does not alter significantly the proteomes of green tissues |journal=Proteomics |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=2131–39 |year=2005 |pmid=15852348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short &quot;bursts&quot; of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala FJ, Escalante AA |title=The evolution of human populations: a molecular perspective |journal=Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=188–201 |year=1996 |pmid=8673287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population, and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically-restricted habitats, and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/15/6764 |journal=Proc.

=== Co-evolution ===
{{main|Co-evolution}}
[[Image:Bombus_6867.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Bumblebee]]s and the [[flower]]s they [[pollinate]] have co-evolved so that both have become dependent on each other for survival.]]

Co-evolution is the  [[biological interaction|mutual]] [[evolution|evolutionary]] influence between two [[species]]. Each party in a co-evolutionary relationship  exerts [[selection|selective pressures]] on the other, thereby affecting each others' evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;co-evo&quot;&gt;Michael Pollan ''[[The Botany of Desire|The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-eye View of the World]]''. Bloomsbury. ISBN 0-7475-6300-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-evolution includes the evolution of a [[host organism|host]] species and its [[parasite]]s, and examples of [[mutualism]] evolving through time. Evolution in response to abiotic factors, such as [[climate change]], is not coevolution (since climate is not alive and does not undergo biological evolution). Evolution in a one-on-one interaction, such as that between [[predation|predator and prey]], host-symbiont or host-parasite pair, is coevolution. But many cases are less clearcut: a species may evolve in response to a number of other species, each of which is also evolving in response to a set of species. This situation has been referred to as &quot;diffuse coevolution&quot;. And, certainly, for many organisms, the biotic (living) environment is the most prominent selective pressure, resulting in evolutionary change.&lt;ref name=&quot;co-evo&quot;/&gt;

Co-evolution also occurs between [[predator]] and [[prey]] species as in the case of the [[Rough-skinned Newt]] (''Taricha granulosa'') and the common [[garter snake]] (''Thamnophis sirtalis'').  In this case, the newts produce a potent nerve [[toxin]] that concentrates in their skin.  Garter snakes have evolved resistance to this toxin through a set of genetic [[mutation]]s, and prey upon the newts.  The relationship between these animals has resulted in an [[evolutionary arms race]] that has driven toxin levels in the newt to extreme levels. (see [[Red Queen]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;co-evo&quot;/&gt;

Co-evolutionary algorithms are also a class of algorithms used for generating [[artificial life]] as well as for optimization, game learning and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;co-evo&quot;/&gt; Pioneering results in the use of co-evolutionary methods were by [[Daniel Hillis]] (who co-evolved sorting networks) and [[Karl Sims]] (who co-evolved [http://www.genarts.com/karl/evolved-virtual-creatures.html virtual creatures]).

== Macroevolution ==
{{see also|Macroevolution|Microevolution}}
Macroevolution is a scale of analysis of [[evolution]] in separated [[gene pool]]s.&lt;ref name = Matzke&gt;[[Nick Matzke|Matzke, Nicholas J.]] and Paul R. Gross. 2006. Analyzing Critical Analysis: The Fallback Antievolutionist Strategy. ''In'' [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Glenn Branch]], ''[[Not in Our Classrooms|Not in Our Classrooms: Why Intelligent Design is Wrong for Our Schools]]'', Beacon Press, Boston ISNB:0807032786&lt;/ref&gt;  Macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of [[species]], in contrast with [[microevolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dobzhansky, Theodosius Grigorievich|title=Genetics and the origin of species|Publisher=New York, Columbia Univ. Press|year=1937|id=LC QH366 .D6}}, p12&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to smaller evolutionary changes (typically described as changes in [[allele frequencies]]) ''within'' a species or population. The process of [[speciation]] may fall within the purview of either, depending on the forces thought to drive it. [[Paleontology]], [[evolutionary developmental biology]], [[comparative genomics]] and [[genomic phylostratigraphy]] contribute most of the evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from one group of dinosaurs.

Arguments over [[macroevolution]] in opposition to [[microevolution]] have waxed and waned through most of the 20th century. Primarily, paleontologists and other evolutionary biologists advanced a variety of non-Darwinian evolutionary processes as explanations for patterns found in the fossil record, emphasizing macroevolution as a source of morphologic innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;macroevo&quot;&gt;Erwin DH, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=11258393 Macroevolution is more than repeated rounds of microevolution], Department of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC 20560, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[paleontologist]]s, from Simpson to Gould, Stanley, and others, accepted the primacy of natural selection but debated that rapid speciation produced a discontinuity between micro- and macroevolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;macroevo&quot;/&gt; This second segment emphasizes the sorting of innovations between species. Other discontinuities emerge in the persistence of trends (differential success of species within clades), including species sorting, in the differential success between clades and in the initiation and establishment of evolutionary novelties. These discontinuities inflict a hierarchical structure to evolution and disgraced any smooth extrapolation from allelic substitution to large-scale evolutionary patterns. Recent developments in comparative developmental biology recommend a need to re-evaluate the possibility that some macroevolutionary discontinuities may be associated with the origination of evolutionary innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;macroevo&quot;/&gt; The attractiveness of macroevolution reflects the comprehensive documentation of large-scale patterns which expose a richness to evolution unexplained by microevolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:digimorphscreenshot300.jpg|200px|right]]Digital Morphology ([http://digimorph.org DigiMorph]), part of the National Science Foundation Digital Libraries Initiative, creates and shares 2D and 3D visualizations of the internal and external structure of living and extinct vertebrates, and a growing number of 'invertebrates.'

The information core for the DigiMorph library is generated using a high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scanner at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. This instrument is comparable to a conventional medical diagnostic [[CAT scanner]], but with greater resolution and penetrating power. The device uses X-rays to take images of thin slices through solid objects, such as bone and rock. Hundreds to thousands of slices are stacked up to create a three-dimensional model of the object, allowing researchers to peer inside without damaging it.

As of 2007, the DigiMorph library contains over a terabyte of imagery of natural history specimens that are important to education and research efforts. The DigiMorph library site now serves imagery, optimized for Web delivery, for over 475 specimens contributed by more than 125 collaborating researchers from natural history museums and universities worldwide.

The CT scanner is housed at the [[Jackson School of Geosciences]] at the University of Texas at Austin and is operated by scientists in [http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT)], a designated NSF-supported Multi-User Facility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Viral evolution''' is a subfield of [[evolutionary biology]] that is specifically concerned with the [[evolution]] of [[virus]]es. Many [[virus]]es, in particular [[RNA virus]]es, have short generation times and relatively high mutation rates (on the order of one point mutation or more per genome per round of replication for RNA viruses). This elevated mutation rate, when combined with [[natural selection]], allows viruses to quickly adapt to changes in their host environment. 

Viral evolution is an important aspect of the [[epidemiology]] of viral diseases such as [[influenza]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis]]. It also causes problems in the development of successful [[vaccine]]s and [[antiviral]] [[medication|drugs]], as [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|resistant mutation]]s often appear within weeks or months after the beginning of the treatment.

RNA viruses are also used as a model system to study evolution in the laboratory.

One of the main theoretical models to study viral evolution is the [[quasispecies model]], as the [[viral quasispecies]].

==Inter-host and Intra-host evolution==
In evolutionary virology and to an extent in the wider field of [[pathology]], inter-host evolution is considered to represent the geological, i.e. visible or detectable, [[evolution]] of a [[virus]] while intra-host evolution represents the invisible evolution of a virus. Adaptive changes acquired by inter-host evolution are rarely lost once acquired. Changes acquired by intra-host evolution may be lost if the evolutionary landscape changes, for example: a population of viruses may become resistant to an [[antiviral]] drug while the host (patient) takes it, but rapidly revert to [[wild-type]] if treatment ceases. 

Changes may include [[point mutations]] or [[Epistasis|epistatic]] mutations, as well as [[genome rearrangements]] to [[genes]] and other [[functional gene sequences]] such as [[gene acquisition]], [[gene creation]] and [[Genetic deletion|gene deletion]] as well as [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] and [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] events.

The '''timeline of human evolution''' outlines the major events in the development of [[human]] [[species]], and the [[evolution]] of humans' [[ancestor]]s. It includes a brief explanation of some [[animal]]s, [[species]] or [[genus|genera]], which are possible ancestors of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. It begins with the [[origin of life]] and presents a possible line of descendants that led to humans. This timeline is based on studies from [[paleontology]], [[developmental biology]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and from [[anatomical]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] data.  The study of human evolution is a major component of [[anthropology]].

However, it serves as a useful model for what the ancestor of sponges and other metazoans may have been like.&quot;  http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/proterospongia.html Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Proterospongia]] (members of the [[Choanoflagellata]]) are the best living examples of what the ancestor of all [[animal]]s may have looked like. 

They live in [[colony (biology)|colonies]], and show a primitive level of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] specialization for different tasks.

The earliest known ancestor of the [[chordates]] is [[Pikaia]]. It is the first known [[animal]] with a [[notochord]]. Pikaia is believed to be the ancestor of all [[chordates]] and [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Obviously vertebrates must have had ancestors living in the Cambrian, but they were assumed to be invertebrate forerunners of the true vertebrates — protochordates. Pikaia has been heavily promoted as the oldest fossil protochordate.&quot; [[Richard Dawkins]] [[2004]] [[The Ancestor's Tale]] Page 289, ISBN 0618005838&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lancelet]], still living today, retains some characteristics of the primitive [[chordate]]s. It resembles [[Pikaia]]

Other earliest known chordate-like fossils is from a [[conodonts]] a &quot;eel-shaped animal of 4-20&amp;nbsp;cm (1½-8&amp;nbsp;in) long&quot; with a pair of huge eyes at the head end were and a complex basket of teeth.

The first [[vertebrate]]s appear: the [[ostracoderms]], jawless fish related to present-day [[lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]]es. ''[[Haikouichthys]]'' and ''[[Myllokunmingia]]'' are examples of these jawless fish, or [[Agnatha]]. (See also [[prehistoric fish]]). They were jawless and their internal skeletons were cartilaginous. They lacked the paired (pectoral and pelvic) [[fins]] of more advanced [[fish]]. They were the Precursors to the [[bony fish]]. &lt;ref&gt;These first vertebrates lacked jaws, like the living hagfish and lampreys. Jawed vertebrates appeared 100 million years later, in the Silurian. http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertintro.html Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Image:PanderichthysZICA.png|thumb|200px|[[Panderichthys]]]]
Some fresh water lobe-finned [[fish]] ([[Sarcopterygii]]) develop legs and give rise to the [[Tetrapoda]].

The first tetrapods [[evolution|evolved]] in shallow and [[swamp]]y [[freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. 

Primitive tetrapods developed from a [[lobe-finned fish]] (an &quot;osteolepid [[sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygian]]&quot;), with a two-lobed [[brain]] in a flattened skull, a wide mouth and a short snout, whose upward-facing eyes show that it was a bottom-dweller, and which had already developed adaptations of fins with fleshy bases and [[bone]]s. The &quot;living fossil&quot; [[coelacanth]] is a related [[lobe-finned fish]] without these shallow-water adaptations. These fishes used their fins as [[paddle]]s in shallow-water habitats choked with plants and [[detritus]]. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s that bend backward at the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] and hind limbs that bend forward at the [[knee]] can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lungfish are believed to be the closest living relatives of the tetrapods, and share a number of important characteristics with them. Among these characters are tooth enamel, separation of pulmonary blood flow from body blood flow, arrangement of the skull bones, and the presence of four similarly sized limbs with the same position and structure as the four tetrapod legs.&quot;  http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/sarco/dipnoi.html Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Panderichthys]] is a 90-130&amp;nbsp;cm (35-50&amp;nbsp;in) long [[fish]] from the Late [[Devonian period]]. It has a large [[tetrapod]]-like [[head]]. Panderichthys exhibits features transitional between [[lobe-finned fish]]es and early [[tetrapods]].

[[Lungfish]]es retain some characteristics of the early [[Tetrapoda]]s. One example is the [[Australian Lungfish]].

|[[Image:Acanthostega2 ZICA.png|thumb|200px|[[Acanthostega]]]]
[[Image:PleaisaidesZICA.png|thumb|200px|[[Ichthyostega]]]]
[[Acanthostega]] is an extinct [[amphibian]], among the first animals to have recognizable [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s. It is a candidate for being one of the first [[vertebrate]]s to be capable of coming onto land. It lacked [[wrist]]s, and was generally poorly adapted for life on land. The limbs could not support the animal's weight. [[Acanthostega]] had both [[lungs]] and [[gills]], also indicating it was a link between [[lobe-finned fish]] and terrestrial vertebrates.

[[Ichthyostega]] is an early [[tetrapod]]. Being one of the first animals with legs, arms, and finger bones, [[Ichthyostega]] is seen as a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a [[fish]] and an [[amphibia]]n. [[Ichthyostega]]' had legs but its [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s probably weren't used for [[walking]], they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw their way through the [[mud]].&lt;ref&gt; &quot;the ancestor that amphibians share with reptiles and ourselves? &quot; &quot; These possibly transitional fossils have been much studied, among 
them Acanthostega, which seems to have been wholly aquatic, and Ichthyostega&quot; [[Richard Dawkins]] [[2004]] [[The Ancestor's Tale]] page 250, ISBN 0618005838&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amphibia]] were the first four-legged animals to develop [[lungs]]. 

[[Amphibia]]ns living today still retain many characteristics of the early [[tetrapods]].
|- valign=&quot;TOP&quot;
| align=&quot;RIGHT&quot; nowrap | 300 Ma
|[[Image:HylonomusZICA.png|thumb|200px|[[Hylonomus]]]]
From amphibians came the first reptiles: [[Hylonomus]] is the earliest known [[reptile]]. It was 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8&amp;nbsp;in) long (including the tail) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern [[lizard]]s. It had small sharp teeth and probably ate [[millipede]]s and early [[insect]]s. It is a precursor of later [[amniote]]s and [[mammal-like reptiles]].

Evolution of the [[amniotic egg]] gives rise to the [[Amniota]], [[reptile]]s that can reproduce on land and lay eggs on dry land. They did not need to return to water for reproduction. This adaptation gave them the capability to colonize the uplands for the first time.

Reptiles have advanced nervous system, compared to [[amphibians]]. They have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.

| [[Image:Phtinosuchus1ZICA.png|thumb|200px|[[Phthinosuchus]], an early [[Therapsid]]]] Shortly after the appearance of the first [[reptile]]s, two branches split off. One branch is the [[Diapsida]] from which come the modern [[reptile]]s. The other branch is [[Synapsida]] which had [[temporal fenestra]], a pair of holes in their skulls behind the eyes, which were used to increase the space for jaw muscles. 

The earliest '''[[mammal-like reptiles]]''' are the [[pelycosaur]]s. The pelycosaurs were the first animals to have temporal fenestra. Pelycosaurs are not [[Therapsida]] but soon they gave rise to them. The Therapsida are the direct ancestor of [[mammals]].

The therapsids have temporal fenestrae larger and more mammal-like than pelycosaurs, their teeth show more serial differentiation; and later forms had evolved a [[secondary palate]]. A secondary palate enables the animal to eat and breathe at the same time and is a sign of a more active, perhaps warm-blooded, way of life. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;In many respects, the pelycosaurs are intermediate between the reptiles and mammals&quot; http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/synapsids/pelycosaurs.html Berkeley University&lt;/ref&gt;

|One sub-group of therapsids, the [[cynodonts]] evolved more mammal-like characteristics.
The jaws of cynodonts resemble modern mammal jaws. It is very likely this group of animals contains a species which is the direct ancestor of all modern mammals.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Tlvinaxodon, like any fossil, should be thought of as a cousin of our ancestor, not the ancestor itself. It was a member of a group of mammal-like reptiles called the cynodonts. The cynodonts were so mammal-like, it is tempting to  call them mammals. But who cares what we call them? They are almost perfect intermediates.&quot; [[Richard Dawkins]] [[2004]] [[The Ancestor's Tale]] page 211, ISBN 0618005838&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no evidence in the fossil record, it is likely that these animals had a constant body temperature, milk glands for their young. The [[neocortex]] region of the [[brain]] first evolved in mammals and thus is unique to them.

A group of small, nocturnal and arboreal, insect-eating mammals called the [[Euarchonta]] begins a speciation that will lead to the [[primate]], [[treeshrew]] and [[flying lemur]] [[order (biology)|orders]]. The [[Primatomorpha]] is a subdivision of Euarchonta that includes the primates and the proto-primate [[Plesiadapiformes]]. One of the early proto-primates is ''[[Plesiadapis]]''. ''Plesiadapis'' still had claws and the eyes located on each side of the head.  Because of this they were faster on the ground than on the top of the trees, but they began to spend long times on lower branches of trees, feeding on [[fruit]]s and [[leaf|leaves]]. The [[Plesiadapiformes]] very likely contain the species which is the ancestor of all primates.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Fossils that might help us reconstruct what Concestor 8 was like include the large group called plesiadapi-forms. They lived about the right time, and they have many of the qualities you would expect of the grand ancestor of all the primates&quot; [[Richard Dawkins]] [[2004]] [[The Ancestor's Tale]] page 136, ISBN 0618005838&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Primate]]s diverge into suborders [[Strepsirrhini]] (wet-nosed primates) and [[Haplorrhini]] (dry nosed primates). Strepsirrhini contains most of the [[prosimian]]s; modern examples include the [[lemur]]s and [[loris]]es. The haplorrhines include the three living groups the prosimian [[tarsier]]s, the simian [[monkey]]s, and [[ape]]s. One of the earliest haplorrhines is ''[[Teilhardina asiatica]]'', a mouse-sized, diurnal creature with small eyes.

[[Haplorrhini]] splits into infraorders [[Platyrrhini]] and [[Catarrhini]]. Platyrrhines, New World monkeys, have prehensile tails and males are color blind. They may have migrated to South America on a raft of vegetation across the Atlantic ocean (circa 4,500&amp;nbsp;km, 2,800&amp;nbsp;mi). Catarrhines mostly stayed in [[Africa]] as the two continents drifted apart. One ancestor of catarrhines might be ''[[Aegyptopithecus]]''.

[[Catarrhini]] splits into 2 superfamilies, [[Old World monkey]]s ([[Cercopithecoidea]]) and [[ape]]s ([[Hominoidea]]).

''[[Proconsul (genus)|Proconsul]]'' was an early [[genus]] of catarrhine primates. They had a mixture of [[Old World monkey]] and [[ape]] characteristics. ''Proconsul'''s [[monkey]]-like features include thin [[tooth]] enamel, a light build with a narrow chest and short forelimbs, and an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle. Its ape-like features are its lack of a [[tail]], ape-like [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]s, and a slightly larger brain relative to body size.

''[[Proconsul africanus]]'' is a possible ancestor of both great and lesser apes, and humans.

''[[Pierolapithecus catalaunicus]]'' is believed to be a [[common ancestor]] of humans and the great apes or at least a species that brings us closer to a common ancestor than any previous [[fossil]] discovery.

''Pierolapithecus'' had special adaptations for tree climbing, just as humans and other great apes do: a wide, flat [[ribcage]], a stiff lower [[vertebral column|spine]], flexible wrists, and [[shoulder]] blades that lie along its back.

'''Biocultural evolution''' is an [[evolution|evolutionary]] process that is the result of culture's interaction with biology throughout [[human evolution|human evolutionary]] history. 

The human predispositon for [[culture]] is perhaps one of the most critical aspects of human evolution and as such has had significant effects both on human and nonhuman biology.

Some examples of biocultural adaptations would be lactose tolerance, the maintenance of the [[sickle cell trait| sickle-cell]] allele in some tropical populations, and cold adaptation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cladogenesis''' is an evolutionary splitting event in which each branch and its smaller branches forms a &quot;[[Cladistics|clade]]&quot;, an evolutionary mechanism and a process of adaptive evolution that leads to the development of a greater variety of sister [[organism]]s. This event usually occurs when a few organisms end up in new, often distant areas or when environmental changes cause several extinctions, opening up ecological niches for the survivors. A great example of cladogenesis today is the [[Hawaiian islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], to which stray organisms traveled across the ocean via ocean currents and winds. Most of the species on the islands are not found anywhere else on Earth due to evolutionary divergence. 

Cladogenesis is often contrasted with '''[[anagenesis]]''', where gradual changes in an ancestral [[species]] lead to its eventual &quot;replacement&quot; by a novel form (i.e., there is no &quot;splitting&quot; of the [[phylogenetic tree]]).

'''Background'''

A Eurobarometer study from 2005 on public scientific knowledge ranked Turkey the worst among 32 European countries. Among the 1005 Turkish participants, only 30% knew that humans and dinosaurs never co-existed, and 27% accepted human evolution.

This grave picture can be considered a simple consequence of the country's poverty and inefficiency of the educational system. However, recent Turkish history has witnessed politically-driven, deliberate attempts to weaken the content of public education. The most infamous example of these has been regarding the teaching of evolution in high-schools: Since 1985 &quot;creation&quot; is taught in Turkish biology classes -the only known current example in the world- and evolution presented as rather unsubstantiated.

Disturbed Turkish scientists and educators are making various attempts to achieve a decent coverage of evolution in public education. Independent of these attempts, however, Turkish scientists and educators bear a heavy responsibility: To increase the level of public scientific knowledge, and accordingly, explain evolution to the Turkish public.

'''The Project'''

Evrim Çalışkanları, or Hard Workers for Evolution, is the name of the collective that undertook the project of translating the [[University of California - Berkeley]]'s website [[Understanding Evolution]] into Turkish, with the aim of popularizing evolution in Turkey.

The project was initiated in summer 2006. The [[Üniversite Konseyleri Derneği]] (Association of University Councils) contacted officials from [[Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley]], and at the same time Turkish graduate students interested in the topic. It quickly turned out that the translation of the above mentioned website had been conceived by many others concerned with popularizing evolution. Indeed, the site is a superb instrument to present evolution to a wide audience, with a comprehensive coverage of the subject, a clear and colorful style and a section dedicated to teachers.

Hence in autumn 2006, different groups joined forces for the project, groups of graduate students in biology, including the Ankara-based collective named [[Evrim Çalışma Grubu]] (Group for the Study of Evolution), members of Üniversite Konseyleri Derneği, and others, including academic researchers in evolutionary biology. As of December 2006, the group had fifty affiliates including about thirty graduate students in biology and more than ten academics.

The website in Turkish is planned to be constructed under that of [[Boğaziçi University]], Istanbul, and to be finished by summer 2007. Whether Evrim Çalışkanları will continue working on other projects to popularize science will be decided at a later stage.

'''Evolutionary ideas of the renaissance and enlightenment''' developed as [[natural history]] became more sophisticated during the 17th and 18th centuries, and as the [[scientific revolution]] and the rise of  [[mechanical philosophy]] encouraged viewing the natural world as a machine whose workings were subject to analysis. Despite this the evolutionary ideas of the early 18th century were of a religious and spiritural nature. In the 2nd half of the 18th century more materialistic and explicit ideas about biological [[evolution]] began to emerge making this an important era in the [[history of evolutionary thought]].  

==17th and early 18th century==
The word ''evolution'' (from the [[Latin]] ''evolutio'', meaning &quot;to unroll like a scroll&quot;) appeared in English in the 17th century, referring to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. Notably, in 1677 Sir [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], attacking the [[atheist]]ic atomism of Democritus and Epicurus, used the term ''evolution'' to describe his opponent's ideas that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void &amp;mdash; without divine intervention &amp;mdash; had formed &quot;Primordial Seeds&quot; (semina) which were the &quot;immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodrum2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodrum|first=|Matthew R.|title=Atomism, Atheism, and the Spontaneous Generation of Human Beings: The Debate over a Natural Origin of the First Humans in Seventeenth-Century Britain|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=63 No. 2|pages=207–224|date=April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hale, this mechanism was &quot;absurd&quot;, because &quot;it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the '''evolution''' whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist ... and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodrum2002&quot; /&gt; 

While Hale (ironically) first used the term evolution in arguing ''against'' the exact mechanistic view the word would come to symbolize, he also demonstrates that at least some [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] theories explored between 1650 and 1800 postulated that the universe, including life on earth, had developed mechanically, entirely without divine guidance. Around this time, the [[mechanical philosophy]] of [[Descartes]], reinforced by the [[physics]] of [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], began to encourage the machine-like view of the universe which would come to characterise the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Bowler-2003|text=Bowler 2003 pp. 33-38}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]] (and mocked by [[Schopenhauer]]), held that evolution was a fundamentally ''spiritual'' process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being &quot;a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, ''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of these theorists, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] postulated in 1714 that &quot;[[monad]]s&quot; inside objects caused motion by internal forces, and maintained that &quot;the 'germs' of all things have always existed ... [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses&quot; to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly felt that evolution proceeded on divine principles &amp;mdash; in his ''De rerum originatione radicali'' (1697), he wrote: &quot;A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref |id=Lovejoy-1936 |text=Lovejoy 1936, p. 257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[J. G. von Herder]], expressed similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref |id=Lovejoy-1936 |text=Lovejoy 1936, pp. 183–184, 279–280, 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid 18th century==
In his ''Venus Physique'' in 1745, and ''System of Nature'' in 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species. He also anticipated in general terms the idea of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Bowler-2003|text= Bowler 2003 pp. 73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vague and general ideas of evolution continued to proliferate among the mid-eighteenth century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers. [[G. L. L. Buffon]] suggested that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties. He thought that the members of what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern [[scientific classification]] would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through [[spontaneous generation]]; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. He speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original forms. Buffon's concept of evolution was strictly limited. He believed there were &quot;internal molds&quot; that shaped the spontaneous generation of each family and that the families themselves were entirely and eternally distinct. Thus, lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and house cats could all share a common ancestor, but dogs and house cats could not.&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Bowler-2003|text= Bowler 2003 pp. 75–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref|id=Larson-2004|text= Larson 2004 pp. 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Darwin's foreword to his 6th edition of ''Origin'' credited [[Aristotle]] with foreshadowing the concept of [[natural selection]], he also wrote that &quot;the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id =Darwin-1872|text= Darwin 1872 p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1767 and 1792 [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] included in his writings not only the concept that that man had descended from primates, but also that, in response to their environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals.  He also produced research on the evolution of [[linguistics]], which was cited by Erasmus Darwin in his poem (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref|id=Darwin-1825|text= Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan-Andrew Henderson states that Monboddo was the first to articulate the theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Henderson-2000| text=Henderson 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1792, philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] presented, in his [[Critique of Judgement]], what he referred to as “a daring venture of reason”, in which “one organic being [is] derived from another organic being, although from one which is specifically different; e.g., certain water-animals transform themselves gradually into marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into land-animals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref|id=Kant-1792|text= Kant 1792 Section 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20th century philosophers, such as [[Eric Voegelin]], credit Kant with foreshadowing modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Voegelin, CW VOL 3,Chapter 14, The Unfolding of the World of Organic Forms pp 142-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1796, [[Erasmus Darwin]] published [[Zoönomia]], which suggested &quot;that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament ... with the power of acquiring new parts&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Darwin-1818|text=Darwin, Erasmus 1818 Vol I section XXXIX}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to stimuli, with each round of improvements being inherited by successive generations. In his 1802 poem ''Temple of Nature'', he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in the mud to its modern diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,&lt;br&gt;
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;&lt;br&gt;
These, as successive generations bloom,&lt;br&gt;
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;&lt;br&gt;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,&lt;br&gt;
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref|id=Darwin-1825|text= Darwin, Erasmus 1825 p. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The eclipse of Darwinism''' was a phrase used by [[Julian Huxley]] to describe the state of affairs prior to the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] when evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles but relatively few biologists believed that [[natural selection]] was its primary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Huxley|1942|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt; Historians of science such as [[Peter J. Bowler]] have used it to describe the [[history of evolutionary thought]] from the 1880s through the first couple of decades of the 20th century when a number of alternatives to [[natural selection]] were developed and explored, and many biologists considered natural selection to have been a wrong guess on Darwin's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bowler|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref|id=Quammen-2006|text=Quammen 2006 pp. 216-223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century, were [[theistic evolution]], [[neo-Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], and [[saltationism]].

==Reasons for the search for alternatives==
Evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years after the publication of ''Origin'', but the acceptance of [[natural selection]] as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. There were a variety of reasons for this. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to many naturalists because they felt it was immoral and left little room for [[teleology]] (purpose) or the concept of &quot;progress&quot; in the development of life. In addition, some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the age of the earth and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]]. Another objection was that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;&gt;{{wikiref|id=Larson-2004|text= Larson 2004 pp. 105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;&gt;{{wikiref|id=Bowler-2003|text= Bowler 2003 pp. 196–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theistic evolution==
Theistic evolution was the idea that a [[God]] intervened in the process of evolution to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. Some of its advocates included [[Asa Gray]], who considered natural selection to be important but believed that God influenced the variations on which it acted, and [[George Jackson Mivart]], and the [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyle]] who both rejected natural selection altogether. However, this idea rapidly fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of [[methodological naturalism]] and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive and a form of [[special pleading]]. By 1900 it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions, although it continued to be used as a way to reconcile religious belief with scientific discoveries among non-scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt;

==Neo-Lamarckism==
The term Lamarckism was used for the idea that characteristics acquired during the course of an organism's life, such as changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ, could be inherited by the next generation. Although [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, [[Charles Darwin]] had included what he called ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.&lt;ref name=toos&gt;{{harv|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century the term [[neo-Lamarckism]] came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], and the American paleontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. The idea of linear progress was also an important part of Haeckel's [[recapitulation theory]] of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt;  

Critics of neo-Lamarckism pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the [[germ plasm theory]] of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired characteristics was flatly impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt; 

===Baldwin effect===
As a consequence of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism in the 1890s [[James Mark Baldwin]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborne]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new instincts and physical traits through [[natural selection]] without resort to the inheritence of acquired characteristics. They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolultion of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the [[Baldwin effect]] and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.&lt;ref&gt; {{wikiref|id=Bowler-2003|text=Bowler 2003 pp. 243, 367}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthogenesis==
Orthogenesis or orthogenetic evolution was the [[hypothesis]] that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo Berg, and the American paleontologist [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. Orthogenesis was particularly popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.  Those who accepted this idea, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). The orthogenesis hypothesis began to collapse when it became clear that it could not explain the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which were non-linear and contained many complications.  A few hung on to the orthogenesis hypothesis as late as the 1950s by claiming that the processes of [[macroevolution]], the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of [[microevolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt;

==Saltationism==
Saltationism was the idea that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was very popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo DeVries]], [[William Bateson]], and early in his career, [[T. H. Morgan]]. This later became the basis of the [[mutation theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson105-129&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler196-250&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mitochondrial Eve''' ('''mt-mrca''') is the name given by researchers to the woman who is defined as the [[matrilineal]] [[most recent common ancestor|most recent common ancestor (MRCA)]] for [[world population|all currently living]] [[humans]]. Passed down from mother to offspring, her [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is now found in all living humans: every mtDNA in every living person is derived from hers. Mitochondrial Eve is the female counterpart of  [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], the [[patrilineal]] most recent common ancestor, although they lived at different times.

She is believed to have lived about 170,000 years ago, or roughly 8,000 generations ago. This places her in a period significantly earlier than the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa migration]] some 60,000 years ago, and close to the first appearance of [[Archaic Homo sapiens|archaic ''Homo sapiens'']] itself, roughly contemporary to early [[List of human evolution fossils|fossil evidence]] found in [[Ethiopia]], such as the [[Omo remains]]  or the ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' fossils. Since Mitochondrial Eve is assumed to have lived in Africa she is sometimes also referred to as '''African Eve'''.

Mitochondrial Eve is the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]] of all humans ''via the mitochondrial DNA pathway'', not the ''unqualified'' MRCA of all humanity.  All living humans can trace their ancestry back to the MRCA via at least one of their parents, but Mitochondrial Eve is defined via the maternal line.  Therefore, she necessarily lived at least as long, though likely much longer, ago than the MRCA of all humanity.

The existence of Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam does not imply the existence of [[population bottleneck]]s or a [[first couple]]. They each may have lived within a large human population at different times.

==Matrilineal descent==
''For more information on the principles involved, see [[matrilineal descent]] and [[genetic genealogy (matrilineal)]].''

To find the Mitochondrial Eve of all living humans, one can start by tracing a line from every individual to his/her mother, then continue those lines from each of those mothers to their mothers and so on, effectively tracing a family tree backward in time based purely on mitochondrial lineages.  Going back through time these mitochondrial lineages will converge when two or more women have the same mother.  The further back in time one goes, the fewer mitochondrial ancestors of living humans there will be.  Eventually only one is left, and this one is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor of all humans alive today, i.e. Mitochondrial Eve.

It is possible to draw the same matrilineal tree forward in time by starting with all human female contemporaries of Mitochondrial Eve.  Some of these women may have died childless.  Others left only male children.  For the rest who became mothers with at least one daughter, one can trace a line forward in time connecting them to their daughter(s).  As the forward lineages progress in time, more and more lineage lines become extinct, as the last female in a line dies childless or leaves no female children.  Eventually, only one single lineage remains, which includes all mothers, and in the next generation, all people, and hence all people alive today.

==Genome sequence==
[[File:Mitochondrial eve tree.gif|thumb|right|250px|Simplified Human mitochondrial phylogeny]]
Mitochondrial Eve's sequence is typically represented as the top root node of the human mitochondrial phylogenetic tree. The first split in the tree is found between [[Haplogroup L0|macrohaplogroup L0]] and [[Haplogroup L1|macrohaplogroup L1]]. From this it can be inferred that Mitochondrial Eve had at least two daughters who survived to have their own children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FvRqtnpVotwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA98,M1|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today L0 is restricted to African populations, whereas L1 is the ancestral haplogroup of all non-Africans, as well as most Africans. Mitochondrial Eve's sequence can be approximated by comparing a sequence from macrohaplogroup L0 with a sequence from macrohaplogroup L1. By reconciling the mutations in L0 and L1, a putative ancestral sequence can be inferred. Usually sequences of chimpanzees and bonobos are used as outgroups to determine the most likely original state of a particular base pair in the human sequences. The mtDNA sequences of contemporary human populations will generally differ from Mitochondrial Eve's sequence by about 50 mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dawn of Human Matrilineal Diversity|last=Behar et al|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2427203#app2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whole-mtDNA Genome Sequence Analysis of Ancient African Lineages|last=Gonder et al|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/3/757|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jogg.info/32/logan.htm A Suggested Genome for “Mitochondrial Eve”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misconceptions==
=====The Mitochondrial Eve and Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) are the same=====
Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ''[[Matrilineality|matrilineal]]'' ancestor, not the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]] of all humans.  The MRCA's offspring have led to all living humans via sons and daughters, but Mitochondrial Eve must be traced only through female lineages, so she is estimated to have been much older than the MRCA.  

Mitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived around 120,000 years ago at the latest. The theoretical MRCA could have lived as recently as 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rohde DL, Olson S, Chang JT |title=Modelling the recent common ancestry of all living humans |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7008 |pages=562–6 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15457259 |doi=10.1038/nature02842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) is the most recent person whom all of humanity can count as one of their ancestors.  Because each person's number of ancestors double (ignoring overlaps) with each generation backwards, the MRCA of all humanity occurs relatively recently in history, even when we take into account ancestor overlap.  The MRCA answers the question, &quot;Do any of my four grandparents overlap with any of your four grandparents?  If not, then do any of my 8 great grandparents overlap with any of your 8 great grandparents?&quot;  Between one-hundred and two-hundred generations back, a single person will appear in every living person's family tree.  However, each person has only one mitochondrial ancestor with each generation backwards because each person inherits their mitochondria from their mother.  The question of &quot;when did Mitochondrial Eve live?&quot; is answering the question of &quot;When does my mother's mother's mother ... overlap with everyone else's mother's mother's mother ... (all the way up the female lineage)?&quot;

=====Mitochrondrial Eve was the only woman alive at that time=====

[[Allan Wilson]]'s naming Mitochondrial Eve&lt;ref name=cann87&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cann RL, Stoneking M, [[Allan Wilson|Wilson AC]] |title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6099 |pages=31–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3025745 |doi=10.1038/325031a0 |url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~landc/html/cann/}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] of the [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis creation account]] has led to some misunderstandings among the general public. A common misconception is that Mitochondrial Eve was the only living human female of her time. Had this been the case, humanity would have long since become [[extinct]] due to an extreme example of a [[population bottleneck]]. {{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Indeed, not only were many women alive at the same time as Mitochondrial Eve but many of them have living descendants through their sons.  While the mtDNA of these women is gone, their [[Nuclear gene]]s are present in today's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;River_Out_of_Eden&quot;&gt;See the chapter ''All Africa and her progenies'' in {{cite book | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | title = [[River Out of Eden]] | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-465-06990-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What distinguishes Mitochondrial Eve (and her matrilineal ancestors) from all her female contemporaries is that she has a purely matrilineal line of descent to all humans alive today, whereas ''all'' her female contemporaries with descendants alive today have ''at least one male'' in every line of descent. Because mitochondrial DNA is only passed through matrilineal descent, all humans alive today have mitochondrial DNA that is traceable back to Mitochondrial Eve.

Furthermore, it can be shown that every female contemporary of Mitochondrial Eve either has no living descendant today or is an ancestor to all living people. Starting with 'the' MRCA at around 3,000 years ago, one can trace all ancestors of the MRCA backward in time.  At every ancestral generation, more and more ancestors (via both paternal and maternal lines) of MRCA are found. These ancestors are by definition also common ancestors of all living people. Eventually, there will be a point in the past where all humans can be divided into two groups: those who left no descendants today and those who are common ancestors of all living humans today. This point in time is termed the [[identical ancestors point]] and is estimated to be between 5,000 and 15,000 years ago. Since Mitochondrial Eve  is estimated to have lived more than a hundred thousand years before the identical ancestors point, every woman contemporary to her is either not an ancestor of any living people, or a common ancestor of all living people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jt_chang_2005&quot;&gt;Rohde, DLT , ''[http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf On the common ancestors of all living humans]''.

== Mitochondrial DNA ==
{{main|Mitochondrial DNA}}
[[Mitochondria]]l [[organelle]]s, which contain [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), are passed only from mother to offspring. A comparison of [[DNA sequence]]s from mtDNA in a population reveals a [[molecular phylogeny]].  Unlike mtDNA, which is outside the nucleus, genes containing [[nuclear DNA]] become [[Genetic recombination|recombined]] after being inherited from both parents, and therefore we can be [[statistic]]ally less certain about nuclear DNA origins than we can for mtDNA, which is only inherited from the mother.  mtDNA also mutates at a higher rate compared to nuclear DNA, so it gives researchers a more useful, magnified view of the diversity present in a population, and its history.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson_1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson AC, Cann RL, Carr SM, ''et al'' |title=Mitochondrial DNA and two perspectives on evolutionary genetics |journal=Biol J Linn Soc Lond. |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=375–400 |year=1985 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb02048.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119851665/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sykes_seven_daughters&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Bryan Sykes|Sykes, Bryan]] |title=[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]] |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-393-02018-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as mitochondria are inherited matrilineally, [[Y-chromosomes]] are inherited patrilineally.&lt;ref name=&quot;sykes_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Bryan Sykes|Sykes, Brian D.]] |title=[[Adam's Curse|Adam's curse: a future without men]] |publisher=Bantam |location=London |year=2003 |isbn=0-593-05005-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is possible to apply the same principles outlined above to men.  The common patrilineal ancestor of all humans alive today has been dubbed [[Y-chromosomal Adam]].  Importantly, the genetic evidence suggests that the most recent patriarch of all humanity is much more recent than the most recent matriarch, suggesting that 'Adam' and 'Eve' were not alive at the same time. While 'Eve' is believed to be alive 140,000 years ago, 'Adam' lived only 60,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;/&gt;

== Mitochondrial clock ==
In order to determine the timing of an evolutionary event such as the origins of the common ancestor of human beings living today for which the fossil record is incomplete, Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling devised the hypothesis of the [[molecular clock]], which dates events based on analysis of change of molecular traits.&lt;ref name=Zuckerkand62&gt; {{cite book | author = [[Emile Zuckerkandl|Zuckerkandl, E.]] and [[Linus Pauling|Pauling, L.B.]] | year = 1962 | title = Horizons in Biochemistry | chapter = Molecular disease, evolution, and genetic heterogeneity | editor = Kasha, M. and Pullman, B (editors) | pages = 189–225 | publisher = Academic Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial assumption for the rate of mutation was made based on the fossil record of human-chimpanzee divergence of 5 million years ago. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} This rate was then applied to date the mitochondrial eve sequence, placing it between 120,000 to 220,000 years ago. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hedges SB, Kumar S, Tamura K, Stoneking M |title=Human origins and analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences |journal=Science |volume=255 |issue=5045 |pages=737–9 |year=1992 |month=February |pmid=1738849 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1738849}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, scientists made a startling discovery. Mitochondrial DNA appeared to mutate faster than expected, which raised troubling questions concerning the dating of evolutionary events. The discovery was made upon comparing the noncoding mitochondrial DNA sequence of the remains of the Russian tsar Nikolai II to that of his relatives. Using this new calibrated clock puts Mitochondrial Eve at a mere 6,000 years ago. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibbons A |title=Calibrating the mitochondrial clock |journal=Science |volume=279 |issue=5347 |pages=28–9 |year=1998 |month=January |pmid=9441404 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9441404}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A subsequent study that used a far greater area of the mitochondrial sequence does not confirm the high rate of mutation, and instead dates Mitochondrial Eve at 170,000 (+/-50,000) years &lt;ref name=Ingman00&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingman M, Kaessmann H, Pääbo S, Gyllensten U |title=Mitochondrial genome variation and the origin of modern humans |journal=Nature |volume=408 |issue=6813 |pages=708–13 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11130070 |doi=10.1038/35047064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have suggested a varying mutation rate or an inconsistent molecular clock. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ho SY, Larson G |title=Molecular clocks: when times are a-changin' |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=79–83 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16356585 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.11.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168-9525(05)00335-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eve and the Out-of-Africa theory==
{{main|Out of Africa hypothesis}}

''[[archaic Homo sapiens|Homo sapiens]]'' is assumed to have speciated from ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' in the period of 200–160 kya. The fact that Mitochondrial Eve happens to be dated to precisely this period has been taken as evidence of a [[population bottleneck]] (e.g. [[Toba catastrophe theory]]) giving rise to the human species.  There are, however, many ways such family trees can be constructed.  A tree can be constructed based on any gene, not just the mitochondrial DNA.  When different such trees including the mtDNA tree are compared, no population bottleneck is found because different trees show different [[Coalescent theory|coalescent]] points.  The inconsistencies between coalescent points indicate that there had been numerous gene interchanges between population groups around the world, even after the first exodus out of Africa.  This idea forms the basis of [[Alan Templeton]]'s 'Out of Africa Again and Again' theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton A |title=Out of Africa again and again |journal=Nature |volume=416 |issue=6876 |pages=45–51 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11882887 |doi=10.1038/416045a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v416/n6876/abs/416045a.html}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Mitochondrial DNA provides another support for the [[Out of Africa hypothesis]] in the form of gene diversity. One finding not subject to interpretation is that the greatest diversity of mitochondrial DNA sequences exists among Africans. This diversity is believed to have  accumulated because humans have been living longer in Africa than anywhere. Family trees (or &quot;[[phylogenetics|phylogenies]]&quot;) constructed on the basis of mitochondrial DNA comparisons show that the living humans whose mitochondrial lineages branched earliest from the tree  ([[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]]) are prevalent among the  [[San people|San]] and the [[Mbuti]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen YS, Olckers A, Schurr TG, Kogelnik AM, Huoponen K, Wallace DC |title=mtDNA variation in the South African Kung and Khwe-and their genetic relationships to other African populations |journal=Am.

== In popular science ==
[[File:Adam and eve newsweek cover.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cover of the January 11, 1988 edition of Newsweek]]

[[Newsweek Magazine]] reported on Mitochondrial Eve based on the Cann ''et al.'' study in January 1988, under a heading of &quot;Scientists Explore a Controversial Theory About Man's Origins&quot;. 
The edition sold record number of copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;oppenheimer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Eve |last=Oppenheimer|authorlink=Stephen Oppenheimer |chapter=Out of Africa |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=bX9E4xlY7YwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA45,M1 |year=2004 |isbn=0786713348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryan Sykes]] has written a [[popular science]] book entitled ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]'' (2001, ISBN 0-393-02018-5) that presents the theory of human mitochondrial genetics to a general audience.

In ''[[River Out of Eden]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] discusses human ancestry in the context of a river of genes and shows that Mitochondrial Eve is one of the many common ancestors we can trace back to via different gene pathways.

The [[Discovery Channel]] produced a [[Documentary film|documentary]] entitled ''[[The Real Eve]]'' (or ''Where We Came From'' in the United Kingdom), based on the book ''Out of Eden'' by [[Stephen Oppenheimer]].

'''''Caridina murrayata''''' is a species of [[shrimp]] found exclusively in [[Lake Murray (South Carolina)]]. Caridina murrayata is believed to be a species derived from a population of C. multidentata that was isolated to Lake Murray in the 1920s when the dam was originally constructed.

==Origin==
According to different sources, ''Caridina multidentata'' was introduced into the waters of [[south carolina]] by [[Ben Tillman]] in the late 1890s. Tillman became acquainted with the shrimp during a stay in [[Japan]]. Knowing that it survived well in fresh water, he thought it would be possible to sustain populations in South Carolina and thereby create revenue selling them inland as an alternative to shrimp imported from Charleston. 
The isolated population in Lake Murray was classified as a new species in the 1990s when it was found that they had anatomical features significantly divergent from those of C. multidentata. There are no known surviving populations of the original C. multidentata in South Carolina waters. The lack of interbreeding is believed to have facilitated the extreme pace of the population's evolutionary divergence. 

==Differences with Caridina multidentata==
C. murrayata are 2-3 centimeters smaller than C. multidentata. The Lake Murray population has lost the small points that run along the sides of C. multidentata, and have a doubling of the white stripe along the dorsal surface.

==Quick facts==
* '''Common names''': Murray shrimp

* '''Adult size''': 2-3 cm

Since so many pages in the wikipedia might be thought of as memes this page will focus on pages that discuss memes and their effect and study. It is strongly suggested that those wishing to list pages as being linked to memes should link to that particular [[meme|page]] or use another category than memetics (such as the subcategories below).

Doing this will keep the memetics category focused on subjects of interest to those interested in memes and resist it being broadened to the incredibly wide list of 'all memes'.

An '''iodide''' [[ion]] is an [[iodine|iodine atom]] with a &amp;minus;1 [[electric charge|charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds with iodine in formal [[oxidation state]] &amp;minus;1 are called '''iodides'''. This can include [[ion]]ic compounds such as [[caesium iodide]] or [[covalent]] compounds such as [[phosphorus triiodide]].  This is the same naming scheme as is seen with [[chloride]]s and [[bromide]]s. The chemical test for an iodide compound is to acidify the aqueous compound by adding some drops of [[acid]], to dispel any carbonate ions present, then adding [[lead(II) nitrate]], yielding a bright yellow [[precipitate]] of [[lead iodide]]. Most ionic iodides are soluble, with the exception of yellow [[silver iodide]] and yellow [[lead iodide]]. Aqueous solutions of iodide dissolve iodine better than pure water due to the formation of [[complex ion]]s:

:I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s) {{unicode|⇌}} I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

The color of new [[triiodide]] ions formed is brown.

==Examples==
Examples or common iodides include:
* [[hydrogen iodide]] (HI)
* [[sodium iodide]] (NaI)
* [[potassium iodide]] (KI)
* [[carbon tetraiodide]] (CI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[silver iodide]] (AgI)
* [[nitrogen triiodide]] (NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Iodide as an antioxidant==
Iodide can function as an antioxidant as it is a [[redox|reducing]] species that can detoxify [[reactive oxygen species]] such as [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Over three billion years ago, [[cyanobacteria|blue-green algae]] were the most primitive oxygenic [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms and are the ancestors of multicellular [[eukaryotic]] algae (1). Algae that contain the highest amount of iodine (1-3 % of dry weight) and peroxidase enzymes, were the first living cells to produce poisonous oxygen in the atmosphere &lt;ref&gt;Küpper FC, Feiters MC, Meyer-Klaucke W, Kroneck PMH, Butler A (2002) Iodine Accumulation in Laminaria (Phaeophyceae): an Inorganic Antioxidant in a Living System?

Planta 207:163-171&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore algal cells required a protective antioxidant action of their molecular components, in which iodides, through peroxidase enzymes, seem to have had this specific role &lt;ref&gt;Ar Gall, E., Küpper, F.C. &amp; Kloareg, B.

Antioxidant biochemical mechanism of iodides, probably one of the most ancient mechanisms of defense from poisonous reactive oxygen species:

:2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Peroxidase  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Tyrosine,  Histidine,  Lipids,  Carbons  →   Iodo-Compounds + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (antioxidants)

Iodo-Compounds: Iodo-Tyrosine, Iodo-Histidine, Iodo-Lipids, Iodo-Carbons.

==Clinical Use==

Iodide (&gt;6mg/day) can be used to treat patients with [[hyperthyroidism]] due to its ability to block the release of [[thyroid hormone]] (TH), known as the Wolff-Chaikoff Effect, from the [[thyroid gland]]. In fact, prior to 1940, iodides were the predominant antithyroid agents. In large doses, iodides inhibit [[proteolysis]] of [[thyroglobulin]]. This permits TH to be synthesized and stored in [[colloid]], but not released into the bloodstream. 

Of note, this treatment is seldom used today as a stand-alone therapy despite the rapid improvement of patients immediately following administration. The major disadvantage of iodide treatment lies in the fact that excessive stores of TH accumulate, slowing the onset of action of [[thioamides]] (TH synthesis blockers). Additionally, the functionality of iodides fade after the initial treatment period. An &quot;escape from block&quot; is also a concern, as extra stored TH may spike following discontinuation of treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Selection_Chart.PNG|thumb|400px|A chart showing three types of selection]]'''Stabilizing selection''', also referred to as '''purifying selection''' or '''ambidirectional selection''', is a type of [[natural selection]] in which [[genetic diversity]] decreases as the [[population]] stabilizes on a particular [[Trait (biological)|trait]] value. Put another way, extreme values of the character are selected against. This is probably the most common mechanism of action for natural selection.

A good classic example of this is human birth weight. Babies of low weight lose heat more quickly and get ill from infectious disease more easily, whereas babies of large body weight are more difficult to deliver through the pelvis. However, the recent improvements in human nutrition in [[developed country|developed countries]] has led to rising rates of [[caesarean section|caesarean sections]] , since babies are routinely out-growing the female reproductive tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liston WA |title=Rising caesarean section rates: can evolution and ecology explain some of the difficulties of modern childbirth? |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=96 |issue=11 |pages=559–61 |year=2003 |pmid=14594971 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=14594971 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.96.11.559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stabilizing selection operates most of the time in most populations.  This type of selection acts to prevent divergence of form and function.  In this way, the anatomy of some organisms, such as sharks and ferns, has remained largely unchanged for millions of years.

Stabilizing selection can sometimes be detected by measuring the fitness of the range of different [[phenotype]]s by various direct measures, but it can also be detected by a variety of tests of molecular sequence data, such as [[Ka/Ks ratio]]s, changes in [[allele frequency]] distributions, and the McDonald Kreitman test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sheets HD, Mitchell CE |title=Why the null matters: statistical tests, random walks and evolution |journal=Genetica |volume=112-113 |issue= |pages=105–25 |year=2001 |pmid=11838761 |doi=10.1023/A:1013308409951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDonald JH, Kreitman M |title=Adaptive protein evolution at the Adh locus in Drosophila |journal=Nature |volume=351 |issue=6328 |pages=652–4 |year=1991 |pmid=1904993 |doi=10.1038/351652a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Darwin among the Machines''''' appeared as the heading of an [[article]] published in [[The Press]] newspaper on [[13 June]] [[1863]] in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. Signed [[Cellarius]] but written by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], the article raised the possibility that machines could [[Evolution|evolve]] &quot;[[mechanical]] [[consciousness]]&quot; by means of [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[natural selection]].
 
==Book of the Machines==
Butler developed this and subsequent articles into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in [[1872]]. From &lt;span style=
&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;
chapter xxiii: the book of the machines&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is no security&quot;--to quote his own words--&quot;against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Erewhonian technophobia==
The Erewhonian society envisioned by Butler came to the conclusion &quot;...that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life.  So... they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years.... (from &lt;span style=
&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;
chapter ix: to the metropolis&lt;/span&gt;.)
Despite the initial popularity of ''Erewhon'', its speculation on the [[evolution]] of &quot;mechanical consciousness&quot; was dismissed as an &quot;attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin.&quot; Furthermore, the type of intelligence envisioned by Butler is ''natural'', not ''artificial''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 Erewhon by Samuel Butler.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of Global Intelligence==
[[George Dyson (science historian)]] applies Butler's original [[premise]] to the [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]] of [[Alan Turing]] in '''''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence''''' (1998) ISBN 0-7382-0030-1, to suggest coherently that the [[Internet]] is a living, [[sentient]] [[being]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dyson's main claim is that the evolution of a conscious mind from today's technology is inevitable. It is not clear whether this will be a single mind or multiple minds, how smart that mind would be, and even if we will be able to communicate with it. He also clearly suggests that there are forms of intelligence on Earth that we are currently unable to understand.

From the book: &quot;What mind, if any, will become apprehensive of the great coiling of ideas now under way is not a meaningless question, but it is still too early in the [[game]] to expect an answer that is meaningful to us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/darwin Excerpted from review] by [http://tal.forum2.org/author_Tal%20Cohen Tal Cohen], 30 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Jewish views on evolution''' includes a continuum of views about [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]].

Some [[Jewish denominations]] accept [[theistic evolution]].

==Classical rabbinic teachings ==
The vast majority of classical [[Rabbi]]s hold that God created the world close to 6,000 years ago, and created [[Adam and Eve]] from [[clay]]. This view is based on a chronology developed in a [[midrash]], ''[[Seder Olam]]'', which was based on a literal reading of the book of [[Genesis]]. It is attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Yose ben Halafta]], and covers history from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Although it is known that a literal approach is not always needed when interpreting the [[Torah]], there is a split over which parts are literal.

Most modern rabbis{{Fact|date=February 2009}} believe that the world is older, and that life as we know it today did not always exist. They believe such a view is needed to accept well-supported scientific theories, such as the [[theory of evolution]].  Rabbis who had this view based their conclusions on verses in the [[Talmud]] or in the [[midrash]]. For example:

* Talmud Chaggiga 13b-14a states that there were 974 generations before God created Adam.
* Some midrashim state that the &quot;first week&quot; of Creation lasted for extremely long periods of time. See Anafim on [[Bahya ben Asher|Rabbenu Bachya's]] Sefer Ikkarim 2:18; Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 9.
* In Psalms it says &quot;A thousand years is like a day in Your sight&quot; (Psalm 90:4)

==Medieval rabbinic teachings==
Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Natan Slifkin|Slifkin, Rabbi Natan]]. ''The Challenge of Creation'', (New York: Yashar Books 2006) page 200.&lt;/ref&gt; held that not every statement in Genesis is meant literally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guide to the Perplexed]], 2:17&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of [[science]]. Indeed, [[Maimonides]], one of the great Rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]], wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Maimonides argued that if science proved a point that did not contradict any fundamentals of faith, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly. &lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nahmanides]], often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the [[Mishnah]] in Tractate Chagigah which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources mention ''Shmitot'' - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of [[yugas]]. [[Nahmanides|Nahmanides']] disciple, [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Rabbi Isaac of Akko]], a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held, that the Universe is about 15 billion year old {{Fact|date=April 2009}} - strikingly close to the modern scientific calculations. According to the tradition of ''Shmitot'', Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.

A literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among classic rabbinic commentators is uncommon. Thus Bible commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra (11th Century) wrote,

''If there appears something in the Torah which contradicts reason…then here one should seek for the solution in a figurative interpretation…the narrative of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for instance, can only be understood in a figurative sense.''

One of several notable exceptions may be the Tosafist commentary on Tractate Rosh Hashanah, where there seems to be an allusion to the age of creation according to a literal reading of Genesis. The non-literal approach is accepted by many as a possible approach within Modern Orthodox Judaism and some segments of Haredi Judaism.

==Jewish views in reaction to Darwin==
With the advent of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory, the Jewish community found itself engaged in a discussion of [[Jewish principles of faith]] and modern scientific findings.

===Post-1800 Kabbalistic views of compatibility===
In his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi [[Bahya ben Asher]] (11th century, Spain) concludes that there were many time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history that man is familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

Rabbi [[Eliyahu Benamozegh]], an [[Italy|Italian]] [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], wrote that were evolution to become a mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long as one understood it as having been guided by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Em LeMikra'' ([[Livorno]] 1863) commenting on [[Deuteronomy]] 22:10, page 87a-88b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] of Danzig (19th century) gave a famous lecture on Torah and [[paleontology]], which is printed in the ''Yachin u-Boaz'' edition of the [[Mishnah]], after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach that the world has gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of thousands of years. He links these teachings to findings about [[geology]] from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists.  He discusses the wooly [[mammoth]] discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous [[dinosaur]] skeletons recently unearthed.  Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states &quot;From all this, we can see that all the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time.&quot;

When scientists first developed the theory of evolution, this idea was seized upon by Rabbis such as [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]], known as the Netziv, who saw Kabbalah as a way to resolve the differences between traditional readings of the Bible and modern day scientific findings.  He proposed that the ancient fossils of dinosaurs were the remains of beings that perished in the previous &quot;worlds&quot; described in some Kabbalistic texts. This was the view held by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (1934-1983).

=== Late 19th century Orthodox view of evolution ===

[[Image:Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.png|200px|frame| Samson Raphael Hirsch]]
In the late 1880s, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], an influential leader in the early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of [[common descent]] (that all life developed from one common [[organism]]), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not pose a threat to Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in [[Evolution]] could instead cause one to be more reverent of God by understanding His wonders (a master plan for the [[universe]]).
:This will never change, not even if the latest scientific notion that the genesis of all the multitudes of organic forms on earth can be traced back to one single, most primitive, primeval form of life should ever appear to be anything more than what it is today, a vague hypothesis still unsupported by fact. Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of &quot;adaptation and heredity&quot; in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures. (Collected Writings, vol. 7 pp. 263-264)

By the early to mid 1900s, the majority of [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] came to accept the existence of evolution as a scientific fact. They interpreted Genesis and related Jewish teachings in light of this fact.

===Modern day Orthodox Jewish views===
The [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) has &quot;maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first 2 chapters of Genesis.&quot;
One can find an array of Orthodox views on the age of the universe, the age of the earth, and views on evolution, in ''Challenge: Torah Views on Science and Its Problems'' edited by Aryeh Carmell and Cyril Domb, Gerald Schroeder's ''Genesis and the Big Bang'' and [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin's]] ''[[The Challenge of Creation]]''. These works attempt to reconcile traditional Jewish texts with modern scientific findings concerning evolution, the age of the earth and the age of the Universe.

Prominent Orthodox rabbis who have affirmed that the world is older, and that life has evolved over time, include [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (1934-1983), Israel Lipschitz, [[Sholom Mordechai Schwadron]] (the MaHaRSHaM) (1835-1911), [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]](1805-1855) and Rabbi Natan Slifkin. These rabbis proposed their own versions of [[theistic evolution]], in which the world is older, and that life does evolve over time in accord with natural law, painting natural law as the process by which God drives the world.

One of the most prominent writers on this subject in the Orthodox Jewish community is [[Gerald Schroeder]], an Israeli [[Physics|physicist]]. He has written a number of articles and popular books attempting to reconcile Jewish theology with modern scientific findings that the world is billions of years old and that life has evolved over time. (''Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery of Harmony Between Modern Science and the Bible'') His work has received approbations from a number of Orthodox rabbinic authorities.

The majority of opposition to evolution from Orthodoxy is founded on ignorance of science, fear of subscribing to concepts largely established with atheistic underpinnings, or both.  For example, no one in Orthodox circles will contest that [[rain]] forms from the condensation of [[water vapor]] as a result of the interplay between physical entities such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]] and the like.  The Orthodox Jewish view, however, clearly establishes that, like most everything else that occurs in life, rain is controlled by God.  It is God's will that determines when, where and how much rain will fall.  Advantageous rainfall is a reward for those who follow God's commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Rosh HaShanah 16a&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientific facts surrounding the formation and delivery of rain in no way contradict the religious perspectives on rainfall; the science behind rainfall is merely the method by which God produces rain.

Similarly, it is well established that [[genetic inheritance]] follows the laws put forth by [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] unless there are complicating factors, such as [[epistasis]] or [[chromosomal crossover]].  If the Jewish view of God asserts that God is the ''borei u'manhig'' (literally, &quot;the creator and manipulator&quot;), how could scientific evidence point to the results of a [[Punnet square]] for the determination of who will have something as benign as blonde hair or as serious as [[cystic fibrosis]]?  The explanation is that God runs the world via natural processes.

The same can be said for the creation of the world.  Whereas the original contributors to the theory of evolution perhaps espoused atheistic or agnostic beliefs, there is no reason to claim that evolutionary theory is any more of a conflict with Judaism than the scientific explanations of rainfall or genetic inheritance.  The fact that Judaism does not contest the scientific basis for rainfall supports the assertion that opposition to evolution is not based on theology nearly as much as it is on politics.

=== Modern day Conservative Jewish views ===

[[Conservative Judaism]] embraces science as a way to learn about God's creation, and like Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has found the theory of evolution a challenge to traditional Jewish theology.  The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged.  Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs at any level.

Many Conservative Rabbis embrace the term [[theistic evolution]], and most reject the term [[intelligent design]].  Conservative rabbis who use the term ''intelligent design'' in their sermons often distinguish their views from the Christian fundamentalist use of this term.  Like most in the scientific community, they understand &quot;intelligent design&quot; to be a technique by fundamentalist Christians to insert religion into public schools and to attack science, as admitted in the Intelligent Design movement's [[wedge strategy]] position papers.

In contrast to fundamentalist views, Conservative Judaism strongly supports the use of science as the proper way to learn about the physical world in which we live, and thus encourages its adherents to find a way to understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of peer-reviewed scientific research.  The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists.  Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows:

Professor [[Ismar Schorsch]], former chancellor of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], writes that:
:The Torah's story of creation is not intended as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very nature of things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.

Rabbi [[David J. Fine]], who has authorized official [[responsa]] for the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], expresses a common Conservative Jewish view on the subject:

:Conservative Judaism has always been premised on the total embrace of critical inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I would say that it is a mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works to the best of our abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.
: 
:But here's where the real question lies. Did God create the world, or not? Is it God's handiwork? Many of the people who accept evolution, even many scientists, believe in what is called &quot;theistic evolution,&quot; that is, that behind the billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, there is room for belief in a creator, God, who set everything into motion, and who stands outside the universe as the cause and reason for life. The difference between that and &quot;intelligent design&quot; is subtle yet significant. Believing scientists claim that belief in God is not incompatible with studying evolution since science looks only for the natural explanations for phenomena. The proponents of intelligent design, on the other hand, deny the ability to explain life on earth through solely natural explanations. That difference, while subtle, is determinative.
:David J. Fine, ''Intelligent Design''

Rabbi Michael Schwab writes:
:...the Jewish view on the first set of questions is much closer to the picture painted by adherents to intelligent design than to those who are strict Darwinians. Judaism, as a religion, and certainly Conservative Judaism, sees creation as a purposeful process directed by God, however each individual defines the Divine. This is clearly in consonance with the theory of Intelligent Design. What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God’s subtle and beautiful plan.
:...However, as unlikely as it may seem, this does not mean for one moment that Judaism’s view rejects wholesale the veracity of Darwin’s theory. In fact, I believe that it is easy to incorporate Darwin and Intelligent design into a meaningful conception of how we humans came into being...
:We have frameworks built into our system to integrate the findings of science into our religious and theological beliefs. That is because we believe that the natural world, and the way it works, was created by God and therefore its workings must be consistent with our religious beliefs.
:...One of the most well known ways our tradition has been able to hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.
:Parshat Noah -- November 4, 2005, ''How Did We Get Here?'' Michael Schwab 

The claim that evolution is [[teleological|purposeful]] is in conflict with modern day evolutionary theory.  The precise way in which God inserts design is not specified by Schwab or other rabbis.

Rabbi [[Lawrence Troster]] is a critic of positions such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows for the role of God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern science can be found in [[process theology]], such as in the writings of [[Hans Jonas]], whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.
:Lecture ''God after Darwin: Evolution and the Order of Creation'' October 21, 2004, Lishmah, New York City, Larry Troster
In a paper on Judaism and [[environmentalism]], Troster writes:
:Jonas is the only Jewish philosopher who has fully integrated philosophy, science, theology and environmental ethics. He maintained that humans have a special place in Creation, manifest in the concept that humans are created in the image of God. His philosophy is very similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead, who believed that God is not static but dynamic, in a continual process of becoming as the universe evolves.

== Jewish opposition to Darwinian theory ==
{{creationism2}}

While most of the Jewish world has declared that there is no conflict between science and Judaism, some [[Haredi]] rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in [[evolution]]ary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian [[creationism|creationists]], they express an openness to multiple interpretations of [[Genesis]], through Jewish [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] and [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]]. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive that it is in conflict with the [[Torah]]'s account of creation.

Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the last rebbe of the worldwide movement of Lubavticher or [[Chabad]] [[Hasidism]], was avidly opposed to evolution, and his tremendous following remains largely committed to that position, though individual Chabad Hasidim may hold different views.

Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], a spokesman for [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]], writes a weekly column that is  widely syndicated in the Jewish press. As an opponent of Darwinian evolutionary theory, Shafran is careful to distinguish the Jewish perspective from that of Christian fundamentalism.  He writes, &quot;An unfortunate side-effect of our affirmation of purpose in creation at a time of controversy is the assumption made by some that we believing Jews share some other groups’ broader skepticism of science. But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy.&quot; Quite the contrary, Shafran remarks, Judaism seeks to learn as much as possible from God's creation.

Shafran also rejects the literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, &quot;Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the ''p’sukim'' (verses) that do not mean what a simple reading would yield.&quot; To Shafran, the Jewish oral tradition is the key to the true meaning of the Torah's words. &quot;There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible to most of us. The words of ''Breishis'' (Genesis, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and the [[Midrash]]im thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of ''HaKodosh Boruch Hu'' (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided.&quot;&lt;ref name=Menken&gt;{{cite web | publication = Cross-Currents |date=December 22, 2005 |title=Rabbi Avi Shafran on Intelligent Design |last=Menken |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moshe Feinstein ===
Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] (1895-1986), a [[Haredi]] [[posek]] who was known for his opposition to evolution, was one of the most famed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and [[posek|decisors]] of [[halakha|Jewish Law]] for the ultra-Orthodox community. Rabbi Feinstein ruled that the reading of an evolutionary textbook is unequivocally forbidden, because belief in evolutionary history is tantamount to ''apikorsus'' (Hebrew, heresy). If a textbook was indispensable for other purposes, Feinstein directed that those pages containing references to evolution be torn out and discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feinstein |first=Moshe |title=Iggorot Moshe, Yoreh De'ah |volume=3:73 |publisher=Noble Press |date=5742/1982 |page=323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Shafran's comments on [[Jewish reactions to intelligent design|intelligent design]] illustrate the distinction that Feinstein was making, that there is an essential difference between animals and humans that evolution does not uphold.

{{quotation|There is simply no philosophically sound way of holding simultaneously in one’s head both the conviction that we are mere evolved animals and the conviction that we are something qualitatively different. And no way to avoid the fact that when schoolchildren are taught biology, if they are taught to embrace the one, they are being taught to shun the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=Menken/&gt;}}

=== Responses to Feinstein's ban ===

Torah MiTzion is a [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] movement in Israel that promotes Torah study together with service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). The organization operates a [[yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]] where soldiers in the IDF can study Torah. According to Torah MiTzion, the study of evolution itself does not present a conflict with [[halakha|Jewish Law]]:  

{{quotation|If biology is so prized a discipline, then so must be evolution &amp;mdash; a central pillar of the life sciences. It is indisputable that organisms adapt to the environment via natural selection, as is evident for instance, by the development of [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic-resistant bacteria]] and [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|antiretroviral-resistant]] [[HIV]]. Further indisputable is the fact that the same [[DNA]] which encodes the blueprint for simple organisms also encodes the blueprint for higher organisms (including human beings) with exquisitely minor variations, demonstrating that evolution need not be limited to microbes. Hence, one might expect on the basis of the foregoing that Halacha would welcome the study of evolution with open arms.&lt;ref name=Bereshit&gt;{{cite web |title=Parshat Bereshit (Torah Commentary on Genesis) |publisher=Torah MitZion | 
url=http://www.torahmitzion.org/heb/resources/show.asp?id=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Torah MiTzion resolves this conflict between Feinstein's [[responsa]] on evolution and the observations of science by distinguishing between &quot;evolution that we can observe&quot; and &quot;evolutionary history.&quot; Its resolution of the matter allows for the study of evolution as a science, but forbids its use to &quot;extrapolate backwards in time&quot; to speculate on matters of creation: 

{{quotation|Evolution that we can observe and measure with our senses is certainly part of the science curriculum that ought to be encouraged. But to extrapolate backwards in time on the basis of circumstantial evidence to so absurd an extent as to supplant the account of the creation of life given by the Torah with that of unverifiable human speculation is not a question of science but rather a revision of history.&lt;ref name=Bereshit/&gt;}}

=== Slifkin affair ===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Slifkin creation.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Banned book by [[Natan Slifkin]]]] --&gt;
{{main|Natan Slifkin}}
[[Image:Slifkin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]]]]
In 2004-2005, three popular books by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] (sometimes pronounced ''Nosson'' Slifkin) were banned by a group of [[Haredi]] rabbinic authorities on the grounds that they were heretical. Known to his admirers as the &quot;Zoo Rabbi,&quot; Nosson Slifkin was the author of ''The Torah Universe'', a series of books on science and religion that were widely read in Orthodox communities until they were suddenly banned. &quot;The books written by Nosson Slifkin present a great [[stumbling block]] to the reader,&quot; the ban declared. &quot;They are full of heresy, twist and misrepresent the words of our sages and ridicule the foundations of our ''emunah'' (faith).&quot; The ban, which prohibited Jews from reading, owning, or distributing Slifkin's books, prompted a widespread backlash in the Orthodox Jewish community.

Jennie Rothenberg, reporting on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', asserted that the incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, &quot;Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of [[Bnei Brak, Israel|Bnai Brak]] and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split on a number of important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it.&quot; Slifkin’s views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community. &quot;He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead.&quot;

== Orthodox scientists respond to Darwin ==

Several Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of [[Torah]]. All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the [[Earth]] and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism. [[Shai Cherry]] writes, &quot;While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 168. &lt;/ref&gt;  

* '''[[Nathan Aviezer]]''', a physicist who trained at the [[University of Chicago]], allows for divine guidance within an evolutionary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man from ''[[homo erectus]]''. As a physicist, he interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including [[Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]]. For Aviezer, the evolutionary framework applies, except where the Hebrew verb ''bara'' (''create'') is used. To Aviezer, &quot;It is particularly meaningful that Modern Man is intellectually and culturally so vastly superior to his closest relative, the extinct [[Neanderthal Man]], even though both species are very similar.&quot; He explains this through a literal interpretation of Genesis 1:27 &amp;mdash; &quot;And God ''created'' Man in His image.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 169-172. &lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Gerald Schroeder]]''', an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] trained physicist, believes that modern science contains nothing inimical to a literal reading of Genesis. Indeed, modern science allows one to understand the &quot;true literal meaning of the Creation narrative.&quot; To Schroeder, it is Einstein's relativity, the &quot;distortion of time facing backwards in a forward rushing cosmos,&quot; that accounts for the compression of time in a 15-billion year-old universe into six days of creation. To Schroeder, the emergence of modern man can be dated to the beginning of writing. Archeologists date the first writing, he notes, &quot;at five or six thousand years ago, the exact period that the Bible tells us the soul of Adam, the ''[[neshama]]'', was created.&quot; To Schroeder, who cites the [[Targum]] of [[Onkelos]], Adam was the first man who could write, and the creation of Adam from more primitive man was a divine ensoulment.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;   

* '''[[Judah Landa]]''', a physicist and teacher at, among other institutions, the [[Yeshivah of Flatbush]], takes a completely different approach. To Landa, [[genetic mutation]] is not a random process, but a divinely guided one that only appears random to humanity. &quot;Evolution was designed and guided, just as the putting together of words and sentences into book forms is accomplished only by design and guidance. A book is designed by its author, evolution was (and continues to be) designed by the laws of nature (which in turn, were designed, we believe, by God). &lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Landa differs from Darwin is in his rejection of the Darwinian notion that evolution has no purpose. Landa does not claim that there is proof of a final purpose for life; he merely asserts that science cannot rule one out. He writes, &quot;God may very well have designed the laws of the universe and the earliest forms of matter and energy with particular life-forms as end-products in mind. Evolution and natural selection may be the vehicles he chose and designed to achieve His purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Aviezar and Schroeder, Landa reconciles science with the biblical account of Genesis, taken literally, but he does so through literary interpretation.

[[Shai Cherry]], Professor of Jewish Thought at [[Vanderbilt University]], remarks that these Modern Orthodox scientists have rejected the approach taken by Jewish theologians. Theologians have tended to use later writings, such as [[Midrash]] and [[Kabbalah]], to reconcile modern science with Genesis. The Orthodox scientists, by comparison, have largely ignored Jewish theology, in favor of a fundamentalist and literalist interpretation of Genesis. Yet in their writings, each of them seeks to reconcile science with Genesis. Cherry speculates, &quot;They were targeting an American Jewish community that privileges science over Torah as a source of scientific knowledge. If Genesis could be shown to have anticipated Darwin or Einstein, then the Bible would regain an aura of truth that it had been losing since the advent of biblical criticism and modern science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 185.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Cherry, the books of Aviezar, Schroeder, and Landa have each sought to strengthen Orthodox Jewry in a time of mounting secularization. Aviezar and Schroeder sought to prove that Genesis anticipates the findings of modern science, and thus increase its status. By contrast, Landa sought to remove a barrier to Orthodox commitment, by proving to secular Jews that Orthodox Judaism and modern science are compatible. At the same time, he sought to persuade students in his own Orthodox community that the study of science is not incompatible with commitment to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish reactions to intelligent design ==

{{main|Jewish reactions to intelligent design}}

The movement for [[intelligent design]] claims that an intelligent creator is responsible for the [[origin of life]] and of humankind. Its proponents claim that their hypothesis is a scientific theory that challenges the Darwinian view of evolution and its modern synthesis. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science, that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement itself. To Rabbi [[Brad Hirschfield]], President of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]], intelligent design is &quot;their attempt to confirm what they already believe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirschfield |first=Brad |title=The Origins of Life: A Jewish Perspective |publisher=National Public Radio |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4761360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations in the [[United States]] have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[creation-evolution controversy]] has a long history, beginning with challenges made by various naturalists to biblical accounts of creation. In response to theories developed by scientists, some religious individuals and organizations questioned the legitimacy of scientific ideas that call into question the creation account in [[Genesis]].  

Interpretation of the Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] had long been the prerogative of a priesthood able to understand [[Latin]], but with the advent of the printing press, the translation of the Bible into other languages, and wider literacy, sundry and more literal understandings of scripture flourished.&lt;ref name=moore06&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed some religious persons and groups to challenge supporters of [[evolution]], such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation/evolution controversy in the age of Darwin==

The Creation-Evolution controversy originated in Europe and North America in the late eighteenth century, when discoveries in [[geology]] led to various theories of an ancient earth, and [[fossil]]s showing past extinctions prompted early ideas of evolution. Such ideas were particularly controversial in England where both the natural world and the hierarchical social order were thought to be fixed by God's will. As the terrors of the [[French Revolution]] developed into the [[Napoleonic Wars]], followed by economic depression threatening revolution in Britain itself, such subversive ideas were rejected, associated only with [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] agitators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p= 34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conditions eased with economic recovery, and when ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' was anonymously published in 1844 its ideas of [[transmutation of species]] attracted wide public interest despite being attacked by the scientific establishment and many theologians who believed it to be in conflict with their interpretations of the biblical account of life's, especially humanity's, origin and development.&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]s, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]s and [[Baptist]]s welcomed the book's ideas of &quot;[[natural law]]&quot; as supporting their struggle to overthrow the privileges of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p= 321-322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation'' remained a best-seller, and paved the way for widespread interest in the theory of [[natural selection]] as introduced and published by English [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] in his [[1859]] book, ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]''. Darwin's book was praised by [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] as well as by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Anglican]] theologians whose ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' sparked considerably more religious controversy in Britain than Darwin's publication, as its support of [[higher criticism]] questioned the historical accuracy of literal interpretations of the Bible and added declarations that miracles were irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p= 500-501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Charles Hodge.JPG|left|thumb|Theologian [[Charles Hodge]], a critic of Darwin's theories, also praised Darwin for his intellectual honesty.]] 

Darwin's book revolutionized the way naturalists viewed the world.  The book and its promotion attracted attention and controversy, and many theologians reacted to Darwin's theories.  For example, in his 1874 work ''What is Darwinism?'' the theologian [[Charles Hodge]] argued that Darwin's theories were tantamount to [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodge|1874|p=177}}, {{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversy was fueled in part by one of Darwin's most vigorous promoters, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], who opined that [[Christianity]] is &quot;a compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of [[Paganism]] and [[Judaism]], moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the [[Western World]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burns, Ralph, Lerner, &amp; Standish|1982|Ref=CITEREFBurnsRalphLernerStandish1982|p=965}}, {{Harvnb|Huxley|1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps the most uncompromising of the evolutionary philosophers was the German, [[Ernst Haeckel|Ernst Heinrick Haeckel]], a professor of biology, who dogmatically affirmed that nothing spiritual exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Burns, Ralph, Lerner, &amp; Standish|1982|Ref=CITEREFBurnsRalphLernerStandish1982|p=965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A watershed in the [[Protestant]] objections to evolution occurred after about [[1875]].&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers_1992_p_13&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, citing [[Louis Agassiz]] and other scientific luminaries, Protestant contributors to religious quarterlies dismissed Darwin's theories as unscientific.&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers_1992_p_13&quot;/&gt;  After 1875, it became clear that the majority of naturalists embraced evolution, and a sizable minority of these Protestant contributors rejected Darwin's theory because it called into question the veracity of Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, virtually none of these dissenters insisted on a young Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest concern for creationists at the turn of the twentieth century was the issue of human ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Darwin ape.jpg|right|thumb|A satirical image of [[Charles Darwin]] as an ape from 1871 reflects part of the social controversy over whether humans and apes share a [[human evolution|common lineage]].]]

{{cquote|I do not wish to meddle with any man's family matters, or quarrel with any one about his relatives.  If a man prefers to look for his kindred in the [[zoo|zoological gardens]], it is no concern of mine; if he wants to believe that the founder of his family was an [[ape]], a [[gorilla]], a [[mud turtle|mud-turtle]], or a [[monera|moner]], he may do so; but when he insists that I shall trace my [[family tree|lineage]] in that direction, I say ''No Sir!''...I prefer that my genealogical table shall end as it now does, with &quot;[[Cainan]], which was the son of [[Seth]], which was the son of [[Generations of Adam|Adam]], which was the [[son of God]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=15}}, quoting H.L Hastings' tract in ''Was Moses Mistaken? or, Creation and Evolution'' (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Creationists during this period were largely [[Premillennialism|premillennialists]], whose belief in Christ's return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the [[garden of eden|Edenic creation]] to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or [[cleric]]s rejected the antiquity of the earth, the progressive nature of the [[fossil|fossil record]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Bibilical flood, unlike subsequent creationists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot;/&gt;  Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or allowed that the [[Creation according to Genesis|six days of creation]] were not necessarily 24-hour days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=18}}, Noting that this applies to published or public skeptics.  Many or most Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation, but these views were rarely expressed in books and journals.  Exceptions are also noted, such as literal interpretations published by Eleazar Lord (1788-1871) and David Nevins Lord (1792-1880).  However, the observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807-1873); [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] (1807-1884); [[John William Dawson]] (1820-1899); Enoch Fitch Burr (1818-1907); George D. Armstrong (1813-1899); [[Charles Hodge]], theologian (1797-1878); [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813-1895); [[Edward Hitchcock]], clergyman and respected Amherst College geologist, (1793-1864); Reverend Herbert W. Morris (1818-1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?-1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838-1922); Alexander Patterson, Presbyterian evangelist who published ''The Other Side of Evolution Its Effects and Fallacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scopes Trial ==
{{main|Scopes Trial}}
Initial reactions in the [[United States]] matched the developments in Britain, and when [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] went there for a lecture tour in 1886–1887 his explanations of &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot; were welcomed without any problems, but attitudes changed after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=moore06&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy became political when [[public schools]] began teaching that man evolved from earlier forms of life per [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[Natural Selection]]. In response, the State of [[Tennessee]] passed a law (the [[Butler Act]] of 1925) prohibiting the teaching of any theory of the origins of humans that contradicted the teachings of the Bible. This law was tested in the highly publicized [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925. The law was upheld by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and remained on the books until 1967 when it was repealed. However, the next year, 1968, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'', [[Case citation|393 U.S. 97]] (1968), that such bans contravened the [[Establishment Clause]] because their primary purpose was religious.

== Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) textbooks ==
In 1937, [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] published [[Genetics and the Origin of Species]], combining [[Mendelian genetics]] with Darwinian [[natural selection]], and explaining, through [[neutral mutation]]s, the source of the variation upon which evolution acted, leading to a [[modern synthesis|synthesis]] that brought together disparate fields of biology and other sciences into a strong, coherent explanation of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/history/modsynth2.shtml Starting “The Modern Synthesis”: Theodosius Dobzhansky]&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign ensued, urging schools to teach the &quot;fact&quot; of evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=248,250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[1960s]], the federally supported Biological Sciences Curriculum Study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bscs.org/ BSCS] official website&lt;/ref&gt; biology text books were introduced, promoting evolution as the organizing principle of biology.&lt;ref name=Larson252&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=246,252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the power of science amongst biologists was running especially high: One of the prominent creators of the [[modern synthesis]], [[Julian Huxley]], made a religion of [[humanism]], saying that a &quot;drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centered pattern&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/library/jh_divin.htm ''The New Divinity''], [[Julian Huxley]]&lt;/ref&gt; and advocating the use of science to further expand human capacities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley ''Transhumanism''], [[Julian Huxley]], 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, public opinion polls suggested that most Americans either believed that God specially created human beings or guided evolution.&lt;ref name=Larson251&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of Scripture continued to rise, with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] outpacing all other denominations.&lt;ref name=Larson251/&gt;  With growth, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media.&lt;ref name=Larson252/&gt; 

With decreasing church membership among evolutionary scientists, the role of opposing the anti-BSCS textbook movement passed from prominent scientists in liberal churches to secular scientists less equipped to reach Christian audiences.&lt;ref name=Larson252/&gt;  Anti-evolutionary forces were able to reduce the number of school districts utilizing BSCS biology text books, but courts continued to prevent religious instruction in public schools.&lt;ref name=Larson253&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICR and the co-opting of the ''creationist'' label ==
{{main|Institute for Creation Research}}
[[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|John C. Whitcomb Jr.'s]] influential ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' was published in [[1961]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}},{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=xi,200-208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with [[dinosaur]]s, and that God created each kind of life. With publication, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris set up the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC), an organization dominated by Baptists, as an adjuct to the [[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSRC rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism, and also published other books such as Kelly Segrave's sensational ''Sons of God Return'' that dealt with [[UFOlogy]], [[flood geology]], and [[demonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284-285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts were against the recommendations of Morris, who urged a more cautious and scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the CSRC broke up, and Morris founded the [[Institute for Creation Research]].  Morris promised that the ICR, unlike the CSRC, would be controlled and operated by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the scientific sounding terms ''scientific creationism'' and ''[[creation science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting {{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255-256}}:  &quot;Fundamentalists no longer merely denounced Darwinism as false; they offered a scientific-sounding alternative of their own, which they called either 'scientific creationism (as distinct from religious creationism) or '[[creation science]]' (as opposed to evolution science.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The flood geologists effectively co-opted &quot;the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=254-255}}, {{Harvnb|Numbers|1998|p=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, ''[[creationism]]'' was a generic term describing a philosophical perspective that presupposes the existence of a supernatural creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayward|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current controversy==
{{main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
The controversy continues to this day, with the [[scientific consensus]] on the origins and evolution of life actively attacked by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually [[young earth creationism]], [[creation science]], [[old earth creationism]] or [[intelligent design]]) as an alternative.  Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to [[evangelism|evangelize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verderame|2007}},{{harvnb|Simon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views which cannot be reconciled (see section on [[Creation-evolution controversy#False dichotomy|the false dichotomy]]).  More accommodating viewpoints, held by mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewey|1994|p=31}}, and {{Harvnb|Wiker|2003}}, summarizing Gould.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the [[Intelligent Design movement]] has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. However, Leonard Krishtalka, a paleontologist and an opponent of the movement, has called intelligent design &quot;nothing more than creationism in a cheap tuxedo&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;As reported in the [[4 May]] [[2005]] edition of the [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402022_2.html Washington Post] &lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' (2005) [[United States district court|United States District Judge]] [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that &quot;intelligent design is not science&quot;, but is &quot;grounded in theology&quot; and &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], Case No. 04cv2688. [[December 20]] [[2005]], Ruling [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|Whether ID Is Science: Page 89]], and [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#H. Conclusion|Conclusion]].&lt;/ref&gt; Before the trial began, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] commented&lt;!--reference for this? on the case and endorsed--&gt; endorsing the teaching of Intelligent design alongside evolution &quot;I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bumiller|2005}}, {{harvnb|Peters &amp; Hewlett|2005|Ref=CITEREFPetersHewlett2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists argue that [[Intelligent design]] does not represent any research program within the scientific community, and is opposed by most of the same groups who oppose creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=258}} &quot;Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of creation science; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.&quot;  See also {{Harvnb|Martz &amp; McDaniel|1987|Ref=CITEREFMartzMcDaniel1987|p=23}}, a Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of the controversy==
* 1650 - [[Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] [[James Usher]] of [[Ireland]] states that the universe was created in 4004 BCE, in direct conflict with the former prevailing [[Aristotle|Aristotlian]] view of a cyclical and eternal earth.
* 1785 - [[James Hutton]] presented his theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], explaining that the Earth must be much older than previously supposed to allow time for mountains to be [[erosion|eroded]] and for sediment to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. 
* 1794 to 1796 - [[Erasmus Darwin]] published [[Zoönomia]] with ideas on evolution and all warm-blooded animals arising from one living filament. 
* 1802 - [[William Paley]] publishes ''Natural Theology'' which uses the [[watchmaker analogy]] to argue for the existence of God from signs of intelligent design in the living world. 
* 1809 - [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed a theory of evolution by acquired characteristics, later known as [[Lamarckism]].
* 1844 - [[Robert Chambers]] anonymously published the ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.
* 1857 - [[Philip Henry Gosse]] published ''[[Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot]]''.  Omphalos is Greek for &quot;[[navel]]&quot;.  Gosse was a brilliant [[natural history|naturalist]] who invented the first stable seawater aquarium.  Gosse's book was an attempt to reconcile biblical literalism with geological uniformitarianism by adopting a [[Surrealist]] or [[Surrogate Realist]] (an anti commonsense realist) view of uniformitarianism and science generally.  The book's Surrealist interpretation of science can be summed up ''God created the world AS IF the teachings of geology &amp; science are true''. Gosse's position is sometimes referred to as &quot;Theological Surrealism&quot; (see [[Jarrett Lepin]] for less trivial examples of Surrealism).  Gosse's theme within the book was whether [[Adam and Eve]] had belly buttons (remnants of a link between the [[placenta]] and the baby).  Since Adam and Eve did not have human parents they should not have belly buttons.  This theme underlies the tension between geological records and biblical fundamentalism.  His book was rejected by both sides of the debate because it &quot;cuts no ice&quot;.  Much of 21st century Creationist, Intelligent Design Theories flirt with Gosse's surrealist tenets to create an alternative and competing science. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}      
* 1859 - [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' regarding the theory of evolution, after over 20 years of research and discovery. Darwin was prompted to publish by the publication of an essay by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], which independently summarized the theory. The theory's most profound element, &quot;[[natural selection]],&quot; challenged the generally accepted idea of divine intervention in species formation, leading to strong [[reaction to Darwin's theory]].
* 1860 - Liberal theologians published ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' supporting Darwin. A debate of Darwin's theory was arranged at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Oxford Museum]], with [[Thomas Huxley]] among its defenders and [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the [[Bishop]] of [[Oxford]] leading its critics. Later accounts indicate Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] was most vocal in defending [[Darwinism]].
* 1925 - The [[Scopes Trial]] ([[Dayton, Tennessee|Dayton, TN]] U.S.A.) tested the new [[Butler Act]], which made it illegal to teach that man descended from animals in public schools. Scopes was found guilty and fined $100; prosecution lawyer [[William Jennings Bryan]] offered to pay it, but it was later set aside on a technicality after appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court.
* 1950 - [[Pope Pius XII]] issued the [[encyclical#Roman Catholic usage|papal encyclical]] ''[[Humani Generis]]'', which states that evolution is compatible with Christianity insofar as to discover &quot;the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter,&quot; but that to apply evolution to matters of spirituality is inappropriate. The Roman Catholic Church has since refined its interpretations of [[Genesis]] as symbolic of spirituality.
* 1958 - The [[National Science Foundation]] started the [http://www.bscs.org/ Biological Sciences Curriculum Study], which emphasizes evolution in high school biology textbooks. This was part of a broad-based improvement of education in the United States in response to the launch of the Soviet Sputnik satellite. (See [[Sputnik crisis]], &quot;[[New Math]]&quot;)
* 1960 - ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by [[Henry M. Morris|Henry Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]] reinvigorated the creationist movement.
* 1968 - A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the [[Epperson v. Arkansas]] case repealed all remaining creationist laws. The Court supported a District Court ruling that the [[Edwards v. Aguillard|&quot;Creationism Act&quot;]] violated the [[Establishment Clause]] because it prohibited the teaching of evolution and it required the teaching of a particular religious doctrine.
* 1973 - Tennessee passed a law requiring textbooks with a theory of origin to give equal emphasis to the Genesis account of Creation. In 1975 it was ruled unconstitutional because it violated the principle of [[separation of church and state]].
* 1991 - ''[[Darwin on Trial]]'' by [[Phillip E. Johnson]] popularized the [[intelligent design]] movement.
* 1996 - [[Michael J. Behe]] wrote ''[[Darwin's Black Box]]'', which proposed that some biological systems are [[irreducibly complex]].
* 1996 - On [[October 22]], [[Pope John Paul II]] sent the message  [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM ''On Evolution''] to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], stating that &quot;fresh knowledge&quot; requires one to realize that evolution is &quot;more than a hypothesis.&quot;
* 1999 - On [[August 11]], the [http://www.ksbe.state.ks.us/ Kansas State Board of Education] deleted discussion of evolution and the [[Big Bang]] from standards relating to state assessments.
* 2001 - The Kansas State Board of Education reinstated the discussion of evolution and the Big Bang after the removal of three board members.
* 2002 - After much debate, the [[Ohio State Board of Education]] partially adopted the new &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot; initiative of intelligent design activists. In 2004 the board created a &quot;Critical Analysis of Evolution&quot; lesson plan for teachers.
* 2004 - On [[January 30]], Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] released a statement condemning the suggestion that the word &quot;evolution&quot; be banned from textbooks used in schools in the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. [http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/01/30/georgia.evolution/index.html]
* 2004 - On [[February 19]], Italian Education Minister [[Letizia Moratti]] issued a legislative decree that Italian children will learn about creationism. On [[April 23]], top Italian scientists responded with an open letter and a petition, signed by more than 50,000 citizens, claiming that her proposal would sacrifice the &quot;scientific curiosity of youth.&quot; [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol304/issue5671/r-samples.dtl#304/5671/677a] Moratti clarified that her proposal did not ban the teaching of evolution, but rescinded the decree nonetheless and even acted to bolster the presence of evolution in Italian academic curricula. [http://www.the-scientist.com/news/20040429/01/]
* 2004 - On [[July 23]], the [http://www.solt3.org/internationaltheologicalcommission.htm International Theological Commission] issued the document [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html ''Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God''].
* 2005 - Evolution went on trial once again in the Kansas State Board of Education. Advertisements pushing intelligent design started to appear in European cities like [[Budapest]] that had been untouched by creationism up to this point. [http://www.cnn.com/2005/EDUCATION/05/02/life.evolution.reut/index.html]
* 2005 - In September, [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|parents in the Dover Area School District legally challenged intelligent design]] after a statement read to students claimed that there are &quot;gaps&quot; in evolution and that intelligent design is an alternative about which they can learn from ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''. In December, the federal court in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] issued a sweeping decision asserting that intelligent design is just another name for creationism, that it is not science, and that it cannot be taught as science in public schools. [http://blog.sciam.com/index.php?title=threw_the_book_at_em&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1]
* 2005 - In November, eight of the nine-member Dover, Pennsylvania school board were voted out and replaced with a coalition of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates who oppose the previous board's decision to introduce intelligent design and lay doubts on evolution.  The coalition ran on the Democratic ticket. The newly elected board members agreed to not appeal the court decision in Kitzmiller and have removed the intelligent design requirements from the school district's curriculum. (See [http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Teaching_Intelligent_Design:_Incumbent_Dover_PA_school_board_fails_reelection Teaching Intelligent Design: Incumbent Dover PA school board fails reelection] .)
*2005 - On December 20 the court in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], the &quot;Dover trial,&quot; issued its ruling that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to [[evolution]] as an &quot;explanation of the origin of life&quot; thus violated the Establishment Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In his ruling, the judge wrote that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], Case No. 04cv2688. [[December 20]] [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2007 - Pope Benedict XVI publishes ''Creation and Evolution'', where he writes &quot;This clash (between evolution and Creationism) is an absurdity because on one hand there is much scientific proof in favor of evolution, which appears as a reality that we must see and which enriches our understanding of life and being as such.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Creation and Evolution, Pope Benedict XVI, 2007, Sankt Ulrich Publishing.

The '''1860 Oxford evolution debate''' took place at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Oxford University Museum]] on [[30 June]] [[1860]], seven months after the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;  Several prominent British scientists and philosophers participated, including [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce]], [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Benjamin Brodie]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Robert FitzRoy]].&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;

The debate is best remembered today for a heated exchange in which Wilberforce supposedly asked Huxley whether it was through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed his descent from a monkey.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{Citation | last = Lucas | first = JR | author-link = John Lucas (philosopher) | title = Wilberforce and Huxley: A Legendary Encounter | journal = The Historical Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–330 | date = June 1979 | year =  | url = http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/legend.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Huxley is said to have replied that he would not be ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used his great gifts to obscure the truth.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;  The encounter is often known as the '''Huxley-Wilberforce debate''' or the '''Wilberforce-Huxley debate'''.

No verbatim account of the debate exists,&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; and there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding what Huxley and Wilberforce actually said.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Charles Darwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]], whose theory was at the centre of the debate.]]
{{Further|[[Reaction to Darwin's theory]]}}

The idea of [[transmutation of species]] was very controversial in the first half of the nineteenth century, seen as contrary to religious orthodoxy and a threat to the social order, but welcomed by [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] seeking to widen democracy and overturn the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] hierarchy. The anonymous publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' in 1844 brought a storm of controversy, but attracted a wide readership and became a bestseller. At the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting at [[Oxford]] in May 1847, the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]] used his Sunday sermon at St. Mary's Church on &quot;the wrong way of doing science&quot; to deliver a stinging attack obviously aimed at its author, [[Robert Chambers]], in a church &quot;crowded to suffocation&quot; with geologists, astronomers and zoologists. The scientific establishment remained hostile to the ideas, but the book had converted a vast popular audience.&lt;ref name=dm&gt;{{Citation | last = Desmond | first = Adrian | last2 = Moore | first2 = James | author2-link =James Moore (biographer) | year = 1991 | title = Darwin | publication-place = London | publisher =Michael Joseph, Penguin Group | isbn =0718134303}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published on [[24 November]] [[1859]] to wide debate and controversy.  The influential biologist [[Richard Owen]] wrote an extremely hostile anonymous review of the book in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last =Owen | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Owen | title =Darwin on the Origin of Species | journal =[[Edinburgh Review]] | issue =111 | pages =487–532 | publication-date = 1860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also coached the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, who wrote an anonymous 17,000-word review in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation | last =Wilberforce | first =Samuel | authorlink =Samuel Wilberforce | title =Darwin's Origin of Species | journal =[[Quarterly Review]] | issue =102 | pages =225–64 | publication-date = 1860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Huxley, who was one of the small group with whom Darwin had shared his theory before publication, emerged as the main champion of evolution.  He wrote a favourable review of the ''Origin'' in ''[[The Times]]'' in December 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Huxley | first =Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley | title =Collected essays: vol 2 Darwiniana |pages=1–20 | publisher =Macmillan | year =1893-94 | location =London }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with several other articles and a lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] in February 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Foster | first=Michael | authorlink1=Michael Foster (physiologist) | last2 =Lankester | first2= E. Ray | authorlink2=Ray Lankester | title=The scientific memoirs of Thomas Henry Huxley. 4 vols and supplement |pages=400 | publisher=Macmillan | publication-date =1898-1903 | location=London | isbn=1432640119 |year=2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of orthodox churchmen was hostile, but their attention was diverted in February 1860 by a much greater furore over the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]]. Amongst them, the Reverend [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] had already praised evolutionary ideas, and in his essay he commended &quot;Mr. Darwin's masterly volume&quot; for substantiating &quot;the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;

The controversy was at the centre of attention when the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] convened a meeting at the new [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in June 1860.  On Thursday [[28 June]], [[Charles Daubeny]] read a paper &quot;On the final causes of the sexuality in plants, with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work....&quot;&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;  Owen and Huxley were both in attendance, and a debate erupted over Darwin's theory.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;  Wilberforce agreed to address the meeting on Saturday morning, and there was expectation that he would repeat his success at scourging evolutionary ideas as at the 1847 meeting.  Huxley was initially reluctant to engage Wilberforce in a public debate about evolution, but [[Robert Chambers]] persuaded him not to desert the cause.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt; The Reverend Baden Powell would have been on the platform, but he had died of a heart attack on 11 June.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;

==Debate==
Word spread that Bishop Wilberforce would speak against Darwin's theory at the meeting on Saturday [[30 June]] [[1860]].  Wilberforce, also known as &quot;Soapy Sam&quot; (this epithet was derived from a comment by [[Benjamin Disraeli]] that the Bishop's manner was &quot;unctuous, oleaginous, saponaceous&quot;), was one of the greatest public speakers of his day&lt;ref name=nhm&gt;[[Natural History Museum]].

Retrieved on [[14 February]] [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Bryson, &quot;more than a thousand people crowded into the chamber; hundreds more were turned away.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bryson&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Bryson |title= [[A Short History of Nearly Everything]] |pages=348–349 |date=2003 |publisher= Doubleday |location=London |language= |isbn=0-7679-0817-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darwin himself was too sick to attend.&lt;ref name=thomson&gt;Thomson, Keith Stewart (2000).  &quot;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2000/5/huxley-wilberforce-and-the-oxford-museum Huxley, Wilberforce and the Oxford Museum]&quot;, ''[[American Scientist]]'', May-June 2000.

The discussion was chaired by [[John Stevens Henslow]], Darwin's former mentor from Cambridge. It has been suggested that Owen arranged for Henslow to chair the discussion &quot;hoping to make the expected defeat of Darwin the more complete&quot;.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;  The main focus of the meeting was supposed to be a lecture by [[New York University]]'s [[John William Draper]], &quot;On the Intellectual Development of Europe, considered with reference to the views of Mr. Darwin and others, that the progression of organisms is determined by law&quot;.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;  By all accounts, Draper's presentation was long and boring.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bryson/&gt;  After Draper had finished, Henslow called on several other speakers, including [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|Benjamin Brodie]], the [[President of the Royal Society]], before it was Wilberforce's turn.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;

In a letter to his brother Edward, Alfred Newton wrote:
:&quot;In the Nat. Hist. Section we had another hot Darwinian debate... After [lengthy preliminaries] Huxley was called upon by Henslow to state his views at greater length, and this brought up the Bp. of Oxford... Referring to what Huxley had said two days before, about after all its not signifying to him whether he was descended from a Gorilla or not, the Bp. chafed him and asked whether he had a preference for the descent being on the father's side or the mother's side? This gave Huxley the opportunity of saying that he would sooner claim kindred with an Ape than with a man like the Bp. who made so ill a use of his wonderful speaking powers to try and burke, by a display of authority, a free discussion on what was, or was not, a matter of truth, and reminded him that on questions of physical science 'authority' had always been bowled out by investigation, as witness astronomy and geology.
:He then got hold of the Bp's assertions and showed how contrary they were to facts, and how he knew nothing about what he had been discoursing on. A lot of people afterwards spoke... the feeling of the meeting was very much against the Bp.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Wollaston AFR 1921. ''Life of Alfred Newton: late Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Cambridge University 1866-1907, with a Preface by Sir Archibald Geikie OM''. Dutton, NY. p118-120. This letter, dated July 25th 1860, is good evidence that the traditional account of the debate is reasonably accurate – it is early in date, by a reliable person versed in biology, but not a personal friend of either participant.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucas, &quot;Wilberforce, contrary to the central tenet of the legend, did not prejudge the issue&quot;&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;, but he is in a minority on this, as Jenson makes clear.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton. The great majority of these accounts do accord with the traditional version.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilberforce criticised Darwin's theory on ostensibly scientific grounds, arguing that it was not supported by the facts, and he noted that the greatest names in science were opposed to the theory.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt; Nonetheless, Wilberforce's speech is generally only remembered today for his inquiry as to whether it was through his grandmother or his grandfather that Huxley considered himself descended from a monkey.

When Huxley heard this he whispered to Brodie, &quot;The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Leonard 1900. ''The Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley''. 2 vols 8vo, Macmillan, London. I p202&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley then rose to defend Darwin's theory, finishing his speech with the now-legendary assertion that he was not ashamed to have a monkey for his ancestor, but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.&lt;ref name=lucas/&gt;  This apparently had a tremendous effect on the audience, and Lady Brewster is said to have fainted.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt;

Next, Henslow called upon Admiral [[Robert FitzRoy]], who had been Darwin's captain and companion on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']] twenty-five years earlier.  FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, &quot;lifting an immense Bible first with both hands and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Vivian H.H. |authorlink=Vivian H. H. Green |title= A New History of Christianity|date= 1996|publisher= Continuum|location=New York |isbn=0-8264-1227-0 |pages= 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last person to speak was [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], Darwin's friend and botanical mentor.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; According to Hooker, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce's arguments: &quot;''Sam was shut up—had not one word to say in reply, and the meeting was dissolved forthwith''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Huxley L. 1918. ''Life and Letters of Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker OM, GCSI''. 2 vols, I p522-5 (letter to Darwin, July 2nd 1860).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse claims that &quot;everybody enjoyed himself immensely and all went cheerfully off to dinner together afterwards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Ruse |title= Can a Darwinian be a Christian? The Relationship between Science and Religion |date= 2001 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-63716-3 |pages= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that during the debate, two Cambridge dons happened to be standing near Wilberforce, one of whom was [[Henry Fawcett]], the recently-blinded economist. Fawcett was asked whether he thought the bishop had actually read the ''Origin of Species''. &quot;Oh no, I would swear he has never read a word of it&quot;, Fawcett reportedly replied loudly. Wilberforce swung round to him scowling,  ready to recriminate, but stepped back and bit his tongue on noting that the protagonist was the blind economist. (See p. 126 of Janet Browne (2003) ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place''.)

==Reaction and legacy==
Summary reports of the debate were published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''The Athenaeum'' and ''Jackson's Oxford Journal''.&lt;ref name=thomson/&gt; Both sides immediately claimed victory, but the majority opinion has always been that the debate represented a major victory for the Darwinians.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark: Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the debate is frequently depicted as a clash between religion and science, a case could be made for saying that for the many clerics in the audience, the underlying conflict was between traditional Anglicanism (Wilberforce) and liberal Anglicanism (''[[Essays and Reviews]]''). Many of the opponents of Darwin's theory were respected men of science: Owen was one of the most influential British biologists of his generation; [[Adam Sedgwick]] was a leading geologist; Wilberforce was a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (though at that time about half of the Fellows were well-placed amateurs). Darwin, Huxley and Hooker were professionals who concentrated on the advance of scientific knowledge, and were determined not to be baulked by religious authority. Their kind of science was to grow and flourish, and to become largely autonomous from religious tradition.

The debate has been called &quot;one of the great stories of the [[history of science]]&quot;&lt;ref name=brooke&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke|Brooke, John Hedley]] (2001). ''[http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/cis/brooke/ Darwinism &amp; Religion: A Revisionist View of the Wilberforce-Huxley Debate]''. Lecture delivered at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] on [[26 February]] [[2001]]. Retrieved on [[14 February]] [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; and it is often regarded as a key moment in the acceptance of evolution. Brooke argues that &quot;the event almost completely disappeared from public awareness until it was resurrected in the 1890s as an appropriate tribute to a recently deceased hero of scientific education&quot;.&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt; Without question, the debate marked the moment when it became clear that Darwinism could not be suppressed the way similar ideas had been earlier in the nineteenth century (see [[William Lawrence (biologist)|Lawrence]]; [[Vestiges of Creation]]).

[[Image:Tenia solium scolex.jpg|thumb|200px|''Tenia solium'', a [[cestoda|cestode]] showing simple cephalization.]]
'''Cephalization''' is an [[evolution]]ary trend, whereby [[nervous system|nervous tissue]], over many generations, becomes concentrated toward one end of an organism. This process eventually produces a [[head]] region with [[sensory system|sensory organs]].&lt;ref&gt;Biology/Neil A. Campbell, Jane B. Reece.-7th Edition (AP Edition) &lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalization is intrinsically connected with a change in [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]]. It accompanied the move to bilateral symmetry made in [[flatworm]]s, with [[ocelli]] and [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] placed in the head region. The cephalization/bilateral symmetry combination allowed animals to have sensory organs facing the direction of movement, allowing a more focused assessment of the environment into which they are moving.  In addition to a concentration of sense organs, all animals from [[annelid]]s on also place the mouth in the head region. This process is also tied to the development of an anterior [[brain]] in the [[chordata|chordates]] from the [[notochord]].  A notable exception to the trend of cephalization throughout evolutionary advancement is [[phylum]] [[Echinoderm]]ata, which, although having a bilateral ancestor, as evidenced by their [[embryology]], develop into a pentaradial animal with no concentrated neural ganglia or sensory head region.  However, some echinoderms have developed bilateral symmetry secondarily.

In [[neuroembryology]], neural induction of the [[ectoderm]] forms a [[neural tube]] which undergoes cephalization to form initially 3, then 5 [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] as a developing embryo. It is the internalized ectoderm which goes on to become the [[central nervous system]], [[peripheral nervous system]] and [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].

In [[respirology]], cephalization refers to the distribution of pulmonary flow from the bases to the apices of the [[lung]] due to [[pulmonary edema]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/rad/cxr/pathology2Bchest.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) Hypothesis''' was first proposed by Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold in 1995 as a way to explain the success of invasive, [[non-indigenous species]] (in particular, plants). Observing that 1) there is usually a lag period between the time of introduction of an [[invasive species]] and the point at which it is considered invasive, and 2) invasive plants seem to be more virulent in habitats into which they have been introduced (as compared to their native habitats), the scientists presumed a sort of [[naturalization]] through modification for non-indigenous plants. Because of a lack of native [[predation]], the scientists reasoned, introduced plants are able to reallocate resources from defense mechanisms into growth and development. Introduced plants can thereby [[evolve]] to grow taller, produce more [[biomass]], and yield more [[viable]] offspring than their native counterparts, according to the hypothesis. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/view/00220477/di985500/98p00847/0&lt;/ref&gt;

Blossey and Nötzold tested their hypothesis on ''[[Lythrum salicaria]]'' (purple loosetrife) by potting seeds from plants growing in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., and Lucelle, Switzerland. The seeds were allowed to [[germinate]] in a lab at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, northern Germany, and observed for two years. True to the predictions of the EICA Hypothesis, the plants derived from Ithaca produced significantly more biomass that the plants derived from Lucelle (with a [[p value]] &gt;0.001). The ''Lythrum salicaria'' plants derived from Ithaca also grew taller and were significantly less resistant to the a root-feeding [[weevil]] present over its native range.

==Significance==

Unlike the notable ideas (concerning the success of invasive non-indigenous organisms) that preceded it, such as the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053021584 CAB Abstracts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Darwin's]] Habituation Hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species. Pg. 114-116. Harvard University Press: eighteenth printing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;, the EICA Hypothesis [[postulates]] that an invasive species is ''not'' as fit (in its introduced habitat) at its moment of introduction as it is at the time that it is considered invasive. As suggested by the name of the hypothesis (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the hypothesis predicts that much of the invasive potential of an invasive species is derived from its ability to evolve to reallocate its resources.

This idea is troubling in that it adds a new variable to &quot;invasive potential&quot;, making it harder to predict whether or not a species will become invasive if it is introduced into a new area. In other words, the EICA Hypothesis presents us with a new environmental safety concern. If its postulates hold, in the long run, [[introduced species]] may have to be more highly regulated than they are at present, because no set of [[traits]] or pattern of introduction can predict the extent to which an organism can reallocate its resources in response to a release from stress.

==Scientific support and revision==

Since its debut in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, &quot;Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis&quot; has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in [[scientific journals]], including [[review articles]], tests of the hypothesis using different [[model species]], and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are ''[[Solidago gigantea]]'' (giant goldenrod)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5v2m075252j1202/ Altered patterns of growth, physiology and reproduction in invasive genotypes of Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae)]&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Sapium sebiferum]]'' (Chinease Tallow) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l847377740371176/ Increased competitive ability and herbivory tolerance in the invasive plant Sapium sebiferum]&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''[[Lepidium draba]]'' (whitetop) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0402043431336n7/ No difference in competitive ability between invasive North American and native European Lepidium draba populations]&lt;/ref&gt;. Of these three model species, the success and behavior of ''Sapium sebifurum'' agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of ''Solidago gigantea'' was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. ''Lepidium draba'' did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.

Through most of the studies done on the EICA Hypothesis (see examples above), it holds that the introduced populations of invasive plant species are less able to cope with the pressures of specialist [[herbivores]] than native populations of the same species are, suggesting that invasive species ''do'' respond to accelerated [[natural selection]] after being released from the [[selective pressure]] of specialist herbivores and ''do'' have the potential to reallocate resources away from specific forms of defense. However, not all of these introduced populations produce significantly more biomass than the native populations of the same species under laboratory conditions. A study conducted by Bossdorf et al. in 2004 on ''Alliaria petiolata'' (garlic mustard) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00583.x Blackwell Synergy - Ecol Letters, Volume 7 Issue 4 Page 346-353, April 2004 (Article Abstract)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; may lend some insight into this discrepancy. Bossdorf et al. potted seeds from native and introduced populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' and put them in direct competition with one another in a laboratory setting (i.e. the native and introduced populations were grown on in the same pot of soil, and subjected to the same treatments), and found that in direct competition, the native populations were able to out-compete the invasive populations. Bossdorf et al. proposed that this observation could result from the fact that there is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost to traits that increase so-called &quot;competitive ability&quot;. Under this assumption, invasive populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' had evolved a higher fitness (similar to ''Lythrum Salicaria'') in their introduced ranges at the cost of certain defense mechanisms ''and'' at the cost of certain aspects of growth and development (dissimilar to ''Lythrum Salicaria''). It could be, therefore, that the EICA Hypothesis is too narrow in scope, and should be reworded to place an emphasis on an invasive species' ability to reallocate its resources in order to procure a fitness advantage that may or may not involve more vigorous growth and development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[alpha taxonomy]], a '''grade''' refers to a level of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and/or [[physiological]] complexity.  Organisms may be grouped by the grade of organisation they display without making any implications about their [[phylogenetic]] relationship. Due to [[convergent evolution]], most grades contain organisms of differing descent, and are thus [[paraphyletic]].

Where information about phylogenetic relationships is available, organisms are preferentially grouped into [[clades]].  Where data is lacking, or two clades of uncertain relationship are to be compared, the cladistic method is limited; then, the grade provides a useful tool for comparing organisms.  

As an example, [[moss]]es and [[liverwort]]s were long thought to represent a clade, but molecular evidence shows the two are in fact separate lineages.&lt;ref name=Qiu2006&gt;{{cite journal

'''Divergent evolution''' is the accumulation of differences between groups which can lead to the formation of new species, usually a result of diffusion of the same species adapting to different environments, leading to natural selection defining the success of specific mutations. Primarily difussion is the basis of molecular division can be seen in some higher-level characters of structure and function that are readily observable in organisms. For example, the [[vertebrate]] limb is one example of divergent evolution. The limb in many different species has a common origin, but has diverged somewhat in overall structure and function. 

Alternatively, &quot;divergent evolution&quot; can be applied to [[molecular biology]] characteristics. This could apply to a pathway in two or more organisms or cell types, for example. This can apply to genes and [[protein]]s, such as [[nucleotide]] sequences or protein sequences that derive from two or more [[homology (biology)|homologous genes]]. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a [[speciation]] event) and paralogous genes (resulting from [[gene duplication]] within a population) can be said to display divergent evolution. Because of the latter, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. 

In the case of divergent evolution, similarity is due to the common origin, such as divergence from a common ancestral structure or function has not yet completely obscured the underlying similarity. In contrast, [[convergent evolution]] arises when there are some sort of ecological or physical drivers toward a similar solution, even though the structure or function has arisen independently, such as different characters converging on a common, similar solution from different points of origin. This includes [[analogous structures]].

==Example==
The apple maggot fly once infested the fruit of a native Australian hawthorn. In the 1860s some maggot flies began to infest apples. They multiplied rapidly because they were able to make use of an abundant food supply. Now there are two distinct species, one that reproduces when the apples are ripe, and another that continues to infest the native hawthorn. They have not only evolved different reproductive timing, but also now have distinctive physical characteristics.

==Usage==
Albert Lester founded the usage of this term and other related terms can vary slightly from one researcher to the next. Furthermore, the actual relationships might be more complex than the simple definitions of these terms allow. &quot;Divergent evolution&quot; is most commonly meant when someone invokes evolutionary relationships and &quot;convergent evolution&quot; is applied when similarity is created by evolution independently creating similar structures and functions. The term [[parallel evolution]] is also sometimes used to describe the appearance of a similar structure in closely related species, whereas convergent evolution is used primarily to refer to similar structures in much more distantly related [[cladistics|clades]]. For example, some might call the modification of the vertebrate limb to become a wing in [[bat]]s and [[bird]]s to be an example of parallel evolution. Vertebrate forelimbs have a common origin and thus, in general, show divergent evolution. However, the modification to the specific structure and function of a wing evolved independently and in parallel within several different vertebrate clades. Also, it has much to do with humans and the way they function from day to day.

In complex structures, there may be other cases where some aspects of the structures are due to divergence and some aspects that might be due to convergence or parallelism. In the case of the eye, it was initially thought that different clades had different origins of the eye, but this is no longer thought by some researchers. It is possible that induction of the light-sensing eye during development might be diverging from a common ancestor across many clades, but the details of how the eye is constructed--and in particular the structures that focus light in cephalapods and vertebrates, for example--might have some convergent or parallel aspects to it, as well. (See Gehring reference below and other researchers cited in that research field). 

A good example of divergent evolution is [[Darwin's finches]], which now have over 80 varieties which all diverged from one original species of [[finch]]. (John Barnes)Another example of divergent evolution are the organisms having the 5 digit pentadactyle limbs like the humans, bats, and whales. they have evolved from a common ancestor but today they are different due to environmental pressures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nylon-eating bacteria''' are a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' that is capable of  digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacture. This strain of ''Flavobacterium'', Sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon-eating bacteria, and the enzymes used to digest the man made molecules became collectively known as '''nylonase'''.

==Discovery==
In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' living in ponds containing [[Wastewater|waste water]] from a factory producing [[nylon]] that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacture, such as the linear dimer of [[Aminocaproic acid|6-aminohexanoate]], even though those substances are not known to have existed before the invention of [[nylon]] in 1935. Further study revealed that the three [[enzyme]]s the [[bacteria]] were using to digest the byproducts were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by other ''Flavobacterium'' strains (or any other bacteria for that matter), and not effective on any material other than the manmade nylon byproducts.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | author = Kinoshita, S. | coauthors = Kageyama, S., Iba, K., Yamada, Y. and Okada, H. |title=Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of e-aminocaproic acid by Achromobacter guttatus |journal=Agricultural &amp; Biological Chemistry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1219−23 |year=1975 |issn=0002-1369 |url=http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/jnlpdf.php?cdjournal=bbb1961&amp;cdvol=39&amp;noissue=6&amp;startpage=1219&amp;lang=en&amp;from=jnltoc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later research ==
This discovery led geneticist [[Susumu Ohno]] to speculate that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a [[gene duplication]] event with a [[frame shift mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohno S |title=Birth of a unique enzyme from an alternative reading frame of the preexisted, internally repetitious coding sequence |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=2421–5 |year=1984 |month=April |pmid=6585807 |pmc=345072 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6585807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved this way.

A series of recent studies by a team led by Seiji Negoro of the University of Hyogo, Japan, suggest that in fact no frameshift mutation was involved in the evolution of the 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Negoro S, Ohki T, Shibata N, ''et al.'' |title=Nylon-oligomer degrading enzyme/substrate complex: catalytic mechanism of 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=370 |issue=1 |pages=142–56 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17512009 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.04.043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other genes have been discovered which did evolve by gene duplication followed by a frameshift mutation affecting at least part of the gene. A 2006 study found 470 examples in humans alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Okamura K, Feuk L, Marquès-Bonet T, Navarro A, Scherer SW |title=Frequent appearance of novel protein-coding sequences by frameshift translation |journal=Genomics |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=690–7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=16890400 |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacteria, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients.  The ''P. aeruginosa'' strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prijambada ID, Negoro S, Yomo T, Urabe I |title=Emergence of nylon oligomer degradation enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through experimental evolution |journal=Appl.

== Role in creation-evolution controversy ==
{{main article|Nylon-eating bacteria and creationism}}
There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. This is seen as a good example of [[evolution]] through mutation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thwaites WM |title=New Proteins Without God's Help |journal=Creation Evolution Journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:monkey-typing.jpg|thumb|250px|Given enough time, a hypothetical [[chimpanzee]] typing at random would, as part of its output, [[almost surely]] produce one of Shakespeare's plays (or any other text).]]

The '''infinite monkey theorem''' states that a [[monkey]] hitting keys at [[random]] on a [[typewriter keyboard]] for an [[infinite]] amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]]. 

In this context, &quot;[[almost surely]]&quot; is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the &quot;monkey&quot; is not an actual monkey; rather, it is a metaphor for an abstract device that produces a [[random sequence]] of letters ''[[ad infinitum]]''. The theorem illustrates the perils of reasoning about infinity by imagining a vast but finite number, and vice versa. The [[probability]] of a monkey typing a given string of text exactly, as long as, for example, Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', is so tiny that, were the experiment conducted, the chance of it actually occurring during a span of time of the order of the [[age of the universe]] is minuscule but not zero.

Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. The history of these statements can be traced back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''On Generation and Corruption'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''De natura deorum'', through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], and finally to modern statements with their iconic typewriters. In the early 20th century, [[Émile Borel]] and [[Arthur Eddington]] used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]]. Various [[Christian apologists]] on the one hand, and [[Richard Dawkins]] on the other, have argued about the appropriateness of the monkeys as a metaphor for [[evolution]]. 

Today, popular interest in the typing monkeys is sustained by numerous appearances in literature, television, radio, music, and the Internet. In 2003, an experiment was performed with six [[Celebes Crested Macaque]]s, but their literary contribution was five pages consisting largely of the letter 'S'.

==Solution==

===Direct proof===
There is a straightforward proof of this theorem. If two events are [[statistically independent]], (i.e. neither affects the outcome of the other), then the [[probability]] of both happening equals the product of the probabilities of each one happening independently. For example, if the chance of rain in Sydney on a particular day is 0.3 and the chance of an earthquake in San Francisco on that day is 0.008 (reasonably assumed to be independent events), then the chance of both happening on that same day is 0.3 × 0.008 = 0.0024.

Suppose the [[typewriter]] has 50 keys, and the word to be typed is &quot;[[wikt:banana|banana]]&quot;. Typing at random, the chance that the first letter typed is ''b'' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is ''a'' is also 1/50, and so on, because events are independent. So the chance of the first six letters matching ''banana'' is
:(1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) = (1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;,
less than one in 15 million.
For the same reason, the chance that the next 6 letters match ''banana'' is also (1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on.

From the above, the chance of ''not'' typing ''banana'' in a given block of 6 letters is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each block is typed independently, the chance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of not typing ''banana'' in any of the first ''n'' blocks of 6 letters is
:&lt;math&gt;X_n=\left(1-\frac{1}{50^6}\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;
As ''n'' grows, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; gets smaller. For an ''n'' of a million, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.9999 (i.e. the chance of not typing ''banana'' is roughly 99.99%), but for an ''n'' of 10 billion ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.53 (i.e. the chance of not typing ''banana'' is roughly 53%) and for an ''n'' of 100 billion it is roughly 0.0017 (i.e. the chance of not typing ''banana'' is roughly 0.17%). As ''n'' approaches infinity, the probability ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[limit (mathematics)|approaches]] zero; that is, by making ''n'' large enough, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be made as small as one likes.&lt;ref&gt;This shows that the probability of typing &quot;banana&quot; in one of the predefined non-overlapping blocks of six letters tends to 1. In addition the word may appear across two blocks, so the estimate given is conservative.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaac |first=Richard E. |title=The Pleasures of Probability |year=1995 |publisher=Springer | isbn = 038794415X |pages=48–50}} Isaac generalizes this argument immediately to variable text and alphabet size; the common main conclusion is on p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same argument shows why at least one of infinitely many monkeys will (almost surely) produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original. In this case ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that none of the first ''n'' monkeys types ''banana'' correctly on their first try. When we consider 100 billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys ''n'' increases, the value of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;—the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text—approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for ''n'' going to infinity, is zero.

However, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time (rather than infinities) the results are reversed.  If we set the number of monkeys equal to the number of particles in the [[observable universe]], 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;, typing 1000 keystrokes per second for 100 times the life of the universe (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), the probability of the monkeys duplicating even a short work of fiction approaches zero.  See [[#Probabilities|Probabilities]], below.

===Infinite strings===
The two statements above can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of [[string (computer science)|string]]s, which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:
* Given an infinite string where each character is chosen [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]], any given finite string almost surely occurs as a substring at some position (and indeed, infinitely many positions).
* Given an infinite sequence of infinite strings, where each character of each string is chosen uniformly at random, any given finite string almost surely occurs as a prefix of one of these strings (and indeed, as a prefix of infinitely many of these strings in the sequence).

Both follow easily from the second [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]. For the second theorem, let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[event (probability theory)|event]] that the ''k''th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability ''p'' of occurring, the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent, and the below sum diverges,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(E_k) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty p = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
the probability that infinitely many of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text, and make ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; the event where the ''k''th block equals the desired string.&lt;ref&gt;The first theorem is proven by a similar if more indirect route in {{cite book |last=Gut |first=Allan |title=Probability: A Graduate Course |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0387228330 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilities===
Ignoring [[punctuation]], spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of ''[[Hamlet]].'' It has a chance of one in 676 (26&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;26) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks [[exponential growth|exponential]]ly, at 20 letters it already has only a chance of one in 26&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376 (almost 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of the entire text of ''Hamlet'', the probabilities are so vanishingly small they can barely be conceived in human terms. The text of Hamlet contains approximately 130,000 letters.&lt;ref&gt;Using the Hamlet text [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/1ws2611.txt from gutenberg], there are 132680 alphabetical letters and 199749 characters overall&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a probability of one in 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For any required string of 130,000 letters from the set a-z, the average number of letters that needs to be typed until the string appears is (rounded) 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;, except in the case that all letters of the required string are equal, in which case the value is about 4% more, 3.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;. In that case failure to have the correct string starting from a particular position reduces with about 4% the probability of a correct string starting from the next position (i.e., for overlapping positions the events of having the correct string are not independent; in this case there is a positive correlation between the two successes, so the chance of success after a failure is smaller than the chance of success in general).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the observable universe were filled with monkeys typing for all time, their total probability to produce a single instance of ''Hamlet'' would still be less than one in 10&lt;sup&gt;183,800&lt;/sup&gt;. As [[Charles Kittel|Kittel]] and [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] put it, &quot;The probability of ''Hamlet'' is therefore zero in any operational sense of an event…&quot;, and the statement that the monkeys must eventually succeed &quot;gives a misleading conclusion about very, very large numbers.&quot; This is from their textbook on [[thermodynamics]], the field whose statistical foundations motivated the first known expositions of typing monkeys.&lt;ref name=&quot;KK&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9 |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Statistical mechanics===

In one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its &quot;dactylographic&quot; [i.e., typewriting] monkeys ({{lang-fr|singes dactylographes}}; the French word ''singe'' covers both the [[monkey]]s and the [[ape]]s), appeared in [[Émile Borel]]'s 1913 article &quot;''Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité''&quot; (''[[Statistical mechanics]] and irreversibility''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Émile Borel | title=''Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité'' | journal=J. Phys. 5e série | volume=3 | year=1913 | pages=189–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book &quot;Le Hasard&quot; in 1914. His &quot;monkeys&quot; are not actual monkeys; rather, they are a metaphor for an imaginary way to produce a large, [[random sequence]] of letters. Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly. 

The physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] drew on Borel's image further in ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928), writing:

{{quote|If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence. If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum. The chance of their doing so is decidedly more favourable than the chance of the molecules returning to one half of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arthur Eddington | title=The Nature of the Physical World: The [[Gifford Lectures]] | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1928 | pages=72 | isbn=0-8414-3885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;KK&quot; /&gt;

===Origins and &quot;The Total Library&quot;===
In a 1939 essay entitled &quot;The Total Library&quot;, Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the infinite-monkey concept back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics.'' Explaining the views of [[Leucippus]], who held that the world arose through the random combination of [[atom]]s, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In ''De Generatione et Corruptione'' (''On Generation and Corruption''), the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same &quot;atoms&quot;, ''i.e.'', alphabetic characters.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Generatione et Corruptione'', 315b14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three centuries later, [[Cicero]]'s ''De natura deorum'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') argued against the atomist worldview:

{{quote|He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the ''Annals'' of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tullius Cicero, ''De natura deorum'', 2.37. Translation from ''Cicero's Tusculan Disputations; Also, Treatises On The Nature Of The Gods, And On The Commonwealth'', C. D. Yonge, principal translator, New York, Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, Franklin Square. (1877). [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988 Downloadable text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges follows the history of this argument through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was &quot;that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.&quot; (To which Borges adds, &quot;Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.&quot;) Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:

{{quote|Everything would be in its blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, [[Aeschylus]]' ''The Egyptians'', the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true nature of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of [[Pierre Fermat]]'s theorem, the unwritten chapters of ''[[Edwin Drood]]'', those same chapters translated into the language spoken by the [[Garamantes]], the paradoxes Berkeley invented concerning Time but didn't publish, Urizen's books of iron, the premature epiphanies of [[Stephen Dedalus]], which would be meaningless before a cycle of a thousand years, the Gnostic [[Gospel of Basilides]], the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves—shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies—ever reward them with a tolerable page.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges, Jorge Luis]]. &quot;''[[The Total Library|La biblioteca total]]''&quot; (The Total Library), ''Sur'' No. 59, August 1939. Trans. by [[Eliot Weinberger]]. In ''Selected Non-Fictions'' (Penguin: 1999), ISBN 0-670-84947-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges's total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story &quot;[[The Library of Babel]]&quot;, which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.

==Applications and criticisms==

===Evolution===
[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley - Project Gutenberg eText 16935.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Thomas Huxley]] is sometimes misattributed with proposing a variant of the theory in his debates with [[Samuel Wilberforce]].]]
In his 1931 book ''The Mysterious Universe'', Eddington's rival [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] attributed the monkey parable to a &quot;Huxley&quot;, presumably meaning [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. This attribution is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thanu |last=Padmanabhan |title=The dark side of astronomy |journal=Nature |volume=435 |pages=20–21 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/435020a}} {{cite book |author=Platt, Suzy; Library of Congress Congressional Research Service |title=Respectfully quoted: a dictionary of quotations |year=1993 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=0880297689|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|now-legendary debate]] over [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, [[Samuel Wilberforce]], held at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Oxford in [[June 30]], [[1860]]. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter itself had yet to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Rescher |title=Studies in the Philosophy of Science |year=2006 |publisher=ontos verlag |isbn=3938793201 |pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primates were still a sensitive topic for other reasons, and the Huxley-Wilberforce debate did include byplay about apes: the bishop asked whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his grandmother's or his grandfather's side, and Huxley responded something to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than from someone who argued as dishonestly as the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. R. |last=Lucas |title=Wilberforce and Huxley: A Legendary Encounter |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=22 |issue=2 |month=June |year=1979 |pages=313–330}} Also available at [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/legend.html], Retrieved on [[2007-03-07]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. For example, Doug Powell argues as a [[Christian apologist]] that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of ''Hamlet'', it has failed to produce ''Hamlet'' because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Doug |title=Holman Quicksource Guide to Christian Apologetics |year=2006 |publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman | isbn = 080549460X |pages=60, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common argument is represented by Reverend [[John F. MacArthur]], who claims that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=MacArthur |title=Think Biblically!: Recovering a Christian Worldview |year=2003 |publisher=Crossway Books |isbn=1581344120 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] employs the typing monkey concept in his 1986 book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to demonstrate the ability of [[natural selection]] to produce biological [[complexity]] out of random [[mutation]]s. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his [[weasel program]] produce the Hamlet phrase ''METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL'', starting from a randomly typed parent, by &quot;breeding&quot; subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent, with random mutations. The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=1986 |title=The Blind Watchmaker |publisher=Oxford UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different avenue for rejecting the analogy between evolution and an unconstrained monkey lies in the problem that the monkey types only one letter at a time, independently of the other letters. [[Hugh Petrie]] argues that a more sophisticated setup is required, in his case not for biological evolution but the evolution of ideas:

{{quote|In order to get the proper analogy, we would have to equip the monkey with a more complex typewriter. It would have to include whole Elizabethan sentences and thoughts. It would have to include Elizabethan beliefs about human action patterns and the causes, Elizabethan morality and science, and linguistic patterns for expressing these. It would probably even have to include an account of the sorts of experiences which shaped Shakespeare's belief structure as a particular example of an Elizabethan. Then, perhaps, we might allow the monkey to play with such a typewriter and produce variants, but the impossibility of obtaining a Shakespearean play is no longer obvious. What is varied really does encapsulate a great deal of already-achieved knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{cite book |first=James |last=Blachowicz |title=Of Two Minds: Nature of Inquiry |year=1998 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0791436411 |pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James W. Valentine]], while admitting that the classic monkey's task is impossible, finds that there is a worthwhile analogy between written English and the [[metazoa]]n genome in this other sense: both have &quot;combinatorial, hierarchical structures&quot; that greatly constrain the immense number of combinations at the alphabet level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Valentine |title=On the Origin of Phyla |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226845486 |pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
[[R. G. Collingwood]] argued in 1938 that art cannot be produced by accident, and wrote as a sarcastic aside to his critics,

{{quote|…some … have denied this proposition, pointing out that if a monkey played with a typewriter … he would produce … the complete text of Shakespeare. Any reader who has nothing to do can amuse himself by calculating how long it would take for the probability to be worth betting on. But the interest of the suggestion lies in the revelation of the mental state of a person who can identify the 'works' of Shakespeare with the series of letters printed on the pages of a book…&lt;ref&gt;p.126 of ''The Principles of Art'', as summarized and quoted by {{cite journal |first=Richard J. |last=Sclafani |title=The logical primitiveness of the concept of a work of art |journal=British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1975 |volume=15 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/15.1.14 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nelson Goodman]] took the contrary position, illustrating his point along with Catherine Elgin by the example of Borges' “[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]”,

{{quote|What Menard wrote is simply another inscription of the text. Any of us can do the same, as can printing presses and photocopiers. Indeed, we are told, if infinitely many monkeys … one would eventually produce a replica of the text. That replica, we maintain, would be as much an instance of the work, ''Don Quixote'', as Cervantes' manuscript, Menard's manuscript, and each copy of the book that ever has been or will be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John, Eileen and Dominic Lopes, editors |title=The Philosophy of Literature: Contemporary and Classic Readings: An Anthology |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-1208-5 |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another writing, Goodman elaborates, &quot;That the monkey may be supposed to have produced his copy randomly makes no difference. It is the same text, and it is open to all the same interpretations….&quot; [[Gérard Genette]] dismisses Goodman's argument as begging the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gérard |last= Genette |title=The Work of Art: Immanence and Transcendence |year=1997 |publisher=Cornell UP |isbn=0801482720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jorge J. E. Gracia]], the question of the identity of texts leads to a different question, that of [[author]]. If a monkey is capable of typing ''Hamlet'', despite having no intention of meaning and therefore disqualifying itself as an author, then it appears that texts do not require authors. Possible solutions include saying that whoever finds the text and identifies it as ''Hamlet'' is the author; or that Shakespeare is the author, the monkey his agent, and the finder merely a user of the text. These solutions have their own difficulties, in that the text appears to have a meaning separate from the other agents: what if the monkey operates before Shakespeare is born, or if Shakespeare is never born, or if no one ever finds the monkey's typescript?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gracia |first=Jorge |title=Texts: Ontological Status, Identity, Author, Audience |year=1996 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-2901-6 |pages=1–2, 122–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random number generation===
The theorem concerns a [[thought experiment]] which cannot be fully carried out in practice, since it is predicted to require prohibitive amounts of time and resources. Nonetheless, it has inspired efforts in finite random text generation.

One computer program run by Dan Oliver of Scottsdale, Arizona, according to an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', came up with a result on August 4, 2004: After the group had worked for 42,162,500,000 billion billion monkey-years, one of the &quot;monkeys&quot; typed, “&lt;tt&gt;VALENTINE. Cease toIdor:eFLP0FRjWK78aXzVOwm)-‘;8.t&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; The first 19 letters of this sequence can be found in &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. Other teams have reproduced 18 characters from &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, 17 from &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and 16 from &quot;Richard II&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/09/070409crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all] Acocella, Joan, &quot;The Typing Life: How writers used to write&quot;, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[April 9]], [[2007]], a review of ''The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History of Typewriting'' (Cornell) 2007, by Darren Wershler-Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

A website entitled The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator, launched on [[July 1]], [[2003]], contained a [[Java applet]] that simulates a large population of monkeys typing randomly, with the stated intention of seeing how long it takes the virtual monkeys to produce a complete Shakespearean play from beginning to end. For example, it produced this partial line from ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', reporting that it took &quot;2,737,850 million billion billion billion monkey-years&quot; to reach 24 matching characters:
:&lt;tt&gt;RUMOUR. Open your ears; 9r&quot;5j5&amp;?OWTY Z0d&lt;/tt&gt;...''

Due to processing power limitations, the program uses a probabilistic model (by using a [[random number generator]] or RNG) instead of actually generating random text and comparing it to Shakespeare. When the simulator &quot;detects a match&quot; (that is, the RNG generates a certain value or a value within a certain range), the simulator simulates the match by generating matched text.

Questions about the statistics describing how often an ideal monkey should type certain strings can motivate practical tests for random number generators as well; these range from the simple to the &quot;quite sophisticated&quot;. Computer science professors [[George Marsaglia]] and [[Arif Zaman]] report that they used to call such tests &quot;overlapping m-[[tuple]] tests&quot; in lecture, since they concern overlapping m-tuples of successive elements in a random sequence. But they found that calling them &quot;monkey tests&quot; helped to motivate the idea with students. They published a report on the class of tests and their results for various RNGs in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Monkey tests for random number generators | authors = Marsaglia G. and Zaman A. | journal = Computers &amp; mathematics with applications | issn = 0898-1221 | year = 1993 | volume = 26 | pages = 1-10 | publisher = Elsevier, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real monkeys==
Primate behaviorists Cheney and Seyfarth remark that real monkeys would indeed have to rely on chance to have any hope of producing ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Unlike [[ape]]s and particularly [[chimpanzee]]s, the evidence suggests that monkeys lack a [[theory of mind]] and are unable to differentiate between their own and others' knowledge, emotions, and beliefs. Even if a monkey could learn to write a play and describe the characters' behavior, it could not reveal the characters' minds and so build an ironic tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cheney, Dorothy L. and Robert M. Seyfarth |title=How Monkeys See the World: Inside the Mind of Another Species |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-226-10246-7 |pages=253–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, lecturers and students from the [[University of Plymouth]] MediaLab Arts course used a £2,000 grant from the [[Arts Council]] to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six [[Celebes Crested Macaque]]s in [[Paignton Zoo]] in [[Devon]] in [[England]] for a month, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website. One researcher, Mike Phillips, defended the expenditure as being cheaper than reality TV and still &quot;very stimulating and fascinating viewing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title= No words to describe monkeys' play | date= [[2003-05-09]] | publisher= BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/3013959.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the monkeys produce nothing but five pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare | url= http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = vivaria.net | year= 2002 | accessdate = 2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting largely of the letter [[S]], the lead male began by bashing the keyboard with a stone, and the monkeys continued by urinating and defecating on it. The zoo's scientific officer remarked that the experiment had &quot;little scientific value, except to show that the 'infinite monkey' theory is flawed&quot;. Phillips said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned &quot;an awful lot&quot; from it. He concluded that monkeys &quot;are not random generators. They're more complex than that. … They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58790,00.html |title=Monkeys Don't Write Shakespeare |author=Associated Press |publisher=Wired News |date= [[2003-05-09]]| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{main|Infinite monkey theorem in popular culture}}
The infinite monkey theorem and its associated imagery is considered a [[popular culture|popular]] and [[proverb]]ial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known to the general public because of its transmission through [[popular culture]] rather than because of its transmission via the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the theorem being referred to as proverbial include: Why Creativity Is Not like the Proverbial Typing Monkey. Jonathan W. Schooler, Sonya Dougal, ''Psychological Inquiry'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1999); and ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' ([[Arthur Koestler]], New York, 1972, page 30): ''&quot;Neo-Darwinism does indeed carry the nineteenth-century brand of materialism to its extreme limits—to the proverbial monkey at the typewriter, hitting by pure chance on the proper keys to produce a Shakespeare sonnet.&quot;'' The latter is sourced from [http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html Parable of the Monkeys], a collection of historical references to the theorem in various formats.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theorem was mentioned in part (and worded differently) and used as a joke in the book &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; by [[Douglas Adams]].

In The Simpsons episode &quot;[[Last Exit to Springfield]],&quot; first aired on 3/11/1993, Mr Burns states: &quot;This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man. Lets see. ''(reading)'' 'It was the best of times, it was the &quot;blurst&quot; of times'! You stupid monkey!&quot; The enduring, widespread and popular nature of the knowledge of the theorem was noted in the introduction to a 2001 paper, &quot;Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks: The Internet in the Light of the Theory of Accidental Excellence&quot; (Hoffmann and Hofmann).&lt;ref&gt;[http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks], Ute Hoffmann &amp; Jeanette Hofmann, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung gGmbH (WZB), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a [[Washington Post]] article said: &quot;Plenty of people have had fun with the famous notion that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time could eventually write the works of Shakespeare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28521-2002Oct27?language=printer &quot;Hello? This is Bob&quot;], Ken Ringle, ''Washington Post'', 28 October 2002, page C01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the previously mentioned [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] funded experiment involving real monkeys and a computer keyboard received widespread press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/documentation/press/ Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare] – some press clippings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the theorem was listed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in a list of eight classic [[thought experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-06/st_best The Best Thought Experiments: Schrödinger's Cat, Borel's Monkeys], Greta Lorge, Wired Magazine: Issue 15.06, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartoonist [[Ruben Bolling]] satirized the thought experiment in his ''[[Tom the Dancing Bug]]'' cartoon, with a monkey asking &quot;How can I credibly delay Hamlet's revenge until Act V&quot; in the final frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/comics/boll/2008/07/10/boll/ Tom the Dancing Bug, Salon.com, 17 July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1987 short play by [[David Ives]], entitled [[Words, Words, Words]], the main plot is what 3 monkeys being used in an Infinite Monkey Theorem experiment would discuss during their time producing Hamlet. The play concludes with one of the monkeys writing the opening lines to Hamlet, while the others are producing random letters.

'''Evolutionary Logic''' is the idea that [[logical rules]] can be [[reduction|reduced]] to biology. 
It is a theory of rationality in which rational and logical rules emerged for pragmatic reasons, and are therefore not special laws. 
The formal systems of logic have ordinarily been studied independently, but (continual) progress in [[evolutionary theory]] suggests that biology and logic could be intimately interrelated. 
Evolutionary Logic suggests that the principles of reasoning are neither fixed, absolute, independent, nor elemental. Instead it is the evolutionary dynamic that is elemental.

William S. Cooper argues in the book'The Evolution of Reason'' that logical rules are derived directly from evolutionary principles. &lt;ref&gt;William S. Cooper. '''The Evolution of Reason: Logic as a Branch of Biology'''. Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Biology. ISBN 978-0521540254&lt;/ref&gt; 
Logical rules are derived directly from evolutionary principles, and therefore, have no metaphysical status of their own. 

==Modularity theory of mind==
{{main|Modularity of mind}}
The Modularity theory of mind is the notion that a mind, at least in part, may be composed of separate innate structures which have established evolutionarily-developed functional purposes. 
Individuals including [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Leda Cosmides]], [[John Tooby]], and [[David Buss]], believed that all brain functions were founded on specific modules – there would be modules for language, for mating, religion, etc, and so logic.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] writes in ''The Prehistory of Mind''(1996), there is evidence that our ancestors began with a generic intelligence, such as we find in apes.

Others have suggested that ancestors developed three major specialized modules: one for naive physics; one for manufacture of instruments; and one for culture and the politics of coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Phenomenon of Man''''' (''Le Phénomène Humain'', 1955) is a non-fiction book written by [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].  In this work, Teilhard describes [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity, culminating in the unification of consciousness.

The book was finished in the 1930s, but was published posthumously in 1955. The Roman Catholic Church considered that Teilhard’s writings contradicted orthodoxy and prohibited their publication.  

''The Phenomenon of Man'' contains many insights that have proven prescient with the development of a complex [[Internet]]-based global society.&lt;ref&gt;A Globe, Clothing Itself With a Brain, from WIRED magazine, June, 1995.[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/teilhard.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Teilhard views [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity.  From the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] to the thinking animal, a process of psychical concentration leads to greater [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;   The emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' marked the beginning of a new age.  Reflection, the power acquired by consciousness to turn in upon itself, raises humankind to a new sphere.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 165. &lt;/ref&gt;   Borrowing [[Julian Huxley]]’s expression, Teilhard describes humankind as evolution becoming conscious of itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Eventually, trade and the transmission of ideas increased.  Traditions became organized and a collective memory was developed.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;   Knowledge accumulated and was transmitted down the ages.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to a further augmentation of consciousness and to the emergence of a thinking layer that enveloped the earth.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  Teilhard called the new layer the “[[noosphere]]” (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “nous,” meaning mind).  Evolution is therefore constructing Mind; in collective psychic unison .&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
The development of [[science]] and [[technology]] caused an expansion of the human sphere of influence, allowing a person to be simultaneously present in every corner of the world.  Humanity has thus become cosmopolitan, stretching a single organized membrane over the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  Teilhard described this process as a “gigantic psychobiological operation, a sort of mega-synthesis, the “super-arrangement” to which all the thinking elements of the earth find themselves today individually and collectively subject.”&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid expansion of the noosphere requires a new domain of psychical expansion, which “is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it.”&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Teilhard’s view, evolution will culminate in the [[Omega Point]], a sort of supreme consciousness.  Layers of consciousness will converge in Omega, fusing and consuming them in itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concentration of a conscious universe would reassemble in itself all consciousnesses as well as all the conscious.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;   Teilhard emphasized that each particular consciousness would remain conscious of itself at the end of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;The Phenomenon of Man, Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

*  “The cell has become someone.  After the grain of matter, the grain of life; and now at last we see constituted the grain of thought.” &lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  “A glow ripples outward from the first spark of conscious reflection.  The point of ignition grows larger.  The fire spreads in ever widening circles till finally the whole planet is covered with incandescence.  It is really a new layer, the thinking layer, which (…) has spread over and above the world of plants and animals.  In other words, outside and above the biosphere there is the noosphere.” &lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  “With hominisation, in spite of the insignificance of the anatomical leap, we have the beginning of a new age.  The earth gets a new skin.  Better still, it finds its soul.” &lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  “In the same beam of light the instinctive groping of the first cell link up with the learned gropings of our laboratories.  (…)  The spirit of research and conquest is the permanent soul of evolution.” &lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

*  “Is this not like some great body which is being born-with its limbs, its nervous system, its perceptive organs, its memory-the body in fact of that great thing which had to come to fulfill the ambitions aroused in the reflective being by the newly acquired consciousness that he was at one with and responsible to an evolutionary All?” &lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Copyright 1961, p. 245-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Peter Medawar|Sir Peter Medawar]] wrote a scornful [http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Medawar/phenomenon-of-man.html review of the book], calling it &quot;a bag of tricks&quot; and saying that the author had shown &quot;an active willingness to be deceived&quot;: &quot;the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''microbial mat''' is a multi-layered sheet of [[micro-organism]]s, mainly [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Microbial mats grow at [[interface]]s between different types of material, mostly on submerged or moist surfaces but a few survive in deserts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SchieberBoseEtAl2007AtlasOfMicrobialMatFeatures&quot;&gt;{{ cite book | title=Atlas of Microbial Mat Features Preserved within the Siliciclastic Rock Record | author=Schieber, J., Bose, P, Eriksson, P.G., Banerjee, S., Sarkar, S., Altermann, W., and Catuneanu, O. | publisher=Elsevier | year=2007 | isbn=0-444-52859-8 | url=http://www.shale-mudstone-research-schieber.indiana.edu/mat-book-2007.htm | accessdate=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They colonize environments ranging in altitude from 10&amp;nbsp;km above sea level to more than 20&amp;nbsp;km below the surface of the oceans and as much as 30&amp;nbsp;km below the surfaces of rocks and sediments, and in temperature from from –40°C to +120°C. A few are found as [[endosymbionts]] of [[animal]]s.

Although only a few centimetres thick at most, microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of micro-organisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely-related species. In moist conditions mats are usually held together by [[Extracellular polymeric substance|slimy substances]] secreted by the micro-organisms, and in many cases some of the micro-organisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called [[stromatolite]]s, but there also spherical forms.

Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good [[fossil]] evidence, from {{ma|3500}}, and have always been the most important members and maintainers of the planet's [[ecosystem]]s. Originally they depended on [[hydrothermal vent]]s for energy and chemical &quot;food&quot;, but the development of [[photosynthesis]] gradually liberated them from the &quot;hydrothermal ghetto&quot; by proving a more widely-available energy source, sunlight, although initially the photosynthesizing mats still depended on the diffusion of chemicals emitted by hydrothermal vents. The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen-producing photosynthesis, since the main chemical inputs for this are [[carbon dioxide]] and water.

As a result microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free [[oxygen]] is a vital component. At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex [[eukaryote]] type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]], of which all [[multicellular]] organisms are composed. Microbial mats covered most of the seabed until the [[Cambrian substrate revolution]], when animals living in shallow seas increased their burowing capabilities  and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant micro-organisms that lived there. Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and the floors of the deep oceans. Hence they are still the major component of life on Earth by weight, and still the main pillar of the planet's ecosystems.

Because of microbial mats' ability to use almost anything as &quot;food&quot;, there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats, especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution.

==Description==
[[Image:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Stromatolites]] are formed by some microbial mats as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment.]]
Microbial mats have also been referred to as &quot;[[algae|algal]] mats&quot; and &quot;[[bacteria]]l mats&quot; in older scientific literature. They are a type of [[biofilm]] that is large enough to see with the naked eye and robust enough to survive moderate physical stresses. These colonies of [[bacteria]] form on surfaces at many types of [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]], for example between water and the [[sediment]] or rock at the bottom, between air and rock or sediment, between soil and bed-rock, etc. Such interfaces form vertical [[Diffusion|chemical gradient]]s, i.e.  vertical variations in chemical composition, which make different levels suitable for different types of bacteria and thus divide microbial mats into layers, which may be sharply defined or may merge more gradually into each  other.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot;&gt;{{ citation | contribution=Biofilm, Biodictyon, Biomat Microbialites, Oolites, Stromatolites, Geophysiology, Global Mechanism, Parahistology | author=Krumbein, W.E., Brehm, U., Gerdes, G., Gorbushina, A.A., Levit, G. and Palinska, K.A. | pages=1–28 | title=Fossil and Recent Biofilms: A Natural History of Life on Earth | editor=Krumbein, W.E., Paterson, D.M., and Zavarzin, G.A. | year=2003 | publisher=Kluwer Academic| isbn=1402015976 | url=http://134.106.242.33/krumbein/htdocs/Archive/397/Krumbein_397.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known types of microbial mat may be flat laminated mats, which form on approximately horizontal surfaces, and [[stromatolites]], stubby pillars built as the microbes slowly move upwards to avoid being smothered by sediment deposited on them by water. However there are also spherical mats, some on the outside of pellets of rock or other firm material and others ''inside'' spheres of sediment.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

===Structure===
A microbial mat consists of several layers, each of which is dominated by specific types of [[micro-organism]], mainly [[bacteria]]. Although the composition of individual mats varies depending on the environment, as a general rule the by-products of each group of micro-organisms serve as &quot;food&quot; for other groups. In effect each mat forms its own [[food chain]], with one or a few groups at the top of the food chain as their by-products are not consumed by other groups. Different types of micro-organism dominate different layers based on their [[comparative advantage]] for living in that layer, in other words they live in positions where they can out-perform other groups rather than where they would absolutely be most comfortable — ecological relationships between different groups are a combination of competition and co-operation. Since the [[metabolism|metabolic]] capabilities of bacteria (what they can &quot;eat&quot; and what conditions they can tolerate) generally depend on their [[phylogeny]] (i.e. the most closely-related groups have the most similar metabolisms), the different layers of a mat are divided both by their different metabolic contributions to the community and by their phylogenetic relationships. For example in a wet environment where sunlight is available, the uppermost layers are generally dominated by [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green bacteria whose color is caused by their having [[chlorophyll]]), while the lowest layers are generally dominated by [[Anaerobic organism|anerobic]] [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Community structure of a microbial mat: the phylogenetic dimension | author=Risatti, J,B., Capman, W.C., and  Stahl, D.A. | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=October 11, 1994 | volume=91 | issue=21 | pages=10173–7 | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/91/21/10173.full.pdf |format=PDF | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.21.10173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial mats are generally held together and bound to their [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]] by slimy [[extracellular polymeric substance]]s which they secrete. In many cases some of the bacteria form filaments (threads), which tangle and thus increase the colonies' structural strength, especially if the filaments have sheaths (tough outer coverings).&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt; 

This combination of slime and tangled threads attracts other micro-organisms which become part of the mat community, for example [[protozoa]], some of which feed on the mat-forming bacteria, and [[diatom]]s, which often seal the surfaces of submerged microbial mats with thin, [[parchment]]-like coverings.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

Marine mats may grow to a few centimeters in thickness, of which only the top few millimeters are oxygenated.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of microbial mats (KOPARA) in the South Pacific atolls of French Polynesia | author=Che, L.M.,  Andréfouët.

===Types of environment colonized===
Underwater microbial mats have been described as layers of &quot;more than 99% biologically solidified water&quot; that live by exploiting and to some extent modifying local [[Diffusion|chemical gradient]]s, i.e.  variations in the chemical composition. Thinner, less complex [[biofilms]] live in many sub-aerial environments (''permanently'' exposed to air), for example on rocks, on mineral particles such as sand, and within [[soil]].   They have to survive for long periods without liquid water, often in a dormant state, and can be described as &quot;thin coatings of 99% organic matter&quot;. Microbial mats that live in tidal zones often contain a large proportion of similar micro-organisms that can survive for several hours without water.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

Microbial mats and less complex types of biofilm are found from 10 km above sea level to more than 20 km below the surface of the oceans, and as deep as 20-30km below the surfaces of rocks and sediments, wherever liquid water is at least occasionally available. They are found at temperature ranges from –40°C to +120°C, because variations in pressure affect the temperatures at which water remains liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

They even appear as [[endosymbiont]]s in some animals, for example in the hindguts of some [[echinoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title= Sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in the burrowing echinoid, ''Echinocardium cordatum'' (Echinodermata) | author=Temara, A., de Ridder, C., Kuenen, J.G.,  and Robertson, L.A. | journal=Marine Biology | 	volume=115 | issue=2 | month=February | year=1993 | doi=10.1007/BF00346333 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hk643302k254181l/  | pages= 179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological and geological importance===
[[Image:Runzelmarken.jpg|thumb|250px|This wrinkled &quot;elephant skin&quot; texture is a [[trace fossil]] of a non-[[stromatolite]] microbial mat.&lt;br /&gt;The image shows the location, in the [[Burgsvik beds]] of [[Sweden]], where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat.&lt;ref name=Manten1966 /&gt;]]

Micro-organisms account for over 99% of all living matter on Earth, and most of the micro-organisms are organized into biofilm and microbial mat communities. Hence these communities are the major factors maintaining life on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

Microbial mats use all of the types of metabolism and feeding strategy that have evolved on Earth — anoxygenic and oxygenic [[photosynthesis]]; anaerobic and aerobic [[chemotroph]]y (using chemistry rather than sunshine as a source of energy); organic and inorganic [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] (i..e converting food into energy with and without using oxygen in the process); [[autotrophy]] (producing food from inorganic compounds) and [[heterotrophy]] (producing food only from organic compounds, by some combination of [[predation]] and [[detritivory]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

Most sedimentary rocks and ore deposits have grown by a [[reef]]-like build-up rather than by &quot;falling&quot; out of the water, and this build-up has been at least influenced and perhaps sometimes caused by the actions of microbes. [[Stromatolites]], bioherms (domes or columns similar internally to stromatolites) and biostromes (distinct sheets of sediment) are among such microbe-influenced build-ups.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt; Other types of microbial mat have created wrinkled &quot;elephant skin&quot; textures in marine sediments, although it was many years before these textures were recognized as [[trace fossil]]s of mats.&lt;ref name=Manten1966&gt;

===The earliest mats===
Microbial mats are among the oldest clear signs of life, as [[stromatolites]] have been found in sediments from {{Ma|3500}} in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt; At that early stage the mats' structure may already have been similar to that of modern mats that do not include [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] bacteria. It is even possible that non-photosynthesizing mats were present as early as {{ma|4000}}. If so, their energy source would have been [[hydrothermal vent]]s, high-pressure [[hot springs]] around submerged [[volcano]]es; and the evolutionary split between [[bacteria]] and [[archea]] may also have occurred around this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Archaean metabolic evolution of microbial mats | author=Nisbet, E.G., and Fowler, C.M.R. | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biology | date=December 7 1999 | volume=266 | issue=1436 | pages=2375 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0934 | pmc=1690475 | accessdate=2008-07-16}} - abstract with link to free full content (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mats were probably small, single-species [[biofilm]]s of [[chemotroph]]s that relied on hydrothermal vents to supply both energy and chemical &quot;food&quot;. Within a short time (by geological standards) the build-up of dead micro-organisms would have created an [[ecological niche]] for scavenging [[heterotroph]]s, possibly [[methanogen|methane-emitting]] and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] organisms that would have formed new layers in the mats and enriched their supply of biologically useful chemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;

===Photosynthesis===
It is generally thought that [[photosynthesis]], the biological generation of energy from light, evolved shortly after {{ma|3000}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- 

From my memories, the consensus is that it was definitely present 2200Ma, and probably present beforehand. This is worth checking out in other sources if possible - Andy Knoll has written a lot on this subject.

--&gt; However an [[isotope analysis]] suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis may have been widespread as early as {{ma|3500}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt; The eminent researcher into Earth's earliest life, William Schopf, argues that, if one did not know their age, one would classify some of the fossil organisms in Australian stromatolites from {{ma|3500}} as [[cyanobacteria]], which are oxygen-producing and oxygen-breathing photosynthesizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schopf1992GeologyAndPaleobiologyOfArchean&quot;&gt;{{ citation |  author=Schopf, J.W. | contribution=Geology and Paleobiology of the Archean Earth | title=The Proterozoic Biosphere: A Multidisciplinary Study | editor=Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C. | year=1992 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0521366151 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jMPfQoFNr-IC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=microbial+mat&amp;source=web&amp;ots=s1cb0GOVjm&amp;sig=YPEFg0M1Dj25SkQh_g50EQkJTKY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1 | accessdate=2008-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different types of photosynthetic reaction, and [[molecular phylogeny|analysis of bacterial DNA]] indicates that photosynthesis first arose in anoxygenic [[purple bacteria]], while the [[Oxygen#Photosynthesis_and_respiration|oxygenic photosynthesis]] seen in [[cyanobacteria]] and much later in [[plant]]s was the last to evolve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blankenship2001EvolutionOfPhotosynthesis&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Molecular evidence for the evolution of photosynthesis | author=Blankenship, R.E. | journal=Trends in Plant Science | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=1 January 2001 | pages=4–6 | doi=10.1038/35085554 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6844/full/412324a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest photosynthesis may have been powered by [[infra-red]] light, using modified versions of [[Pigment (biology)|pigments]] whose original function was to detect infra-red heat emissions from hydrothermal vents. The development of photosynthetic energy generation enabled the micro-organisms first to colonize wider areas around vents and then to use sunlight as an energy source. The role of the hydrothermal vents was now limited to supplying reduced metals into the oceans as a whole rather than being the main supporters of life in specific locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blankenship2001EvolutionOfPhotosynthesis&quot; /&gt; Heterotrophic scavengers would have accompanied the photosynthesizers in their migration out of the &quot;hydrothermal ghetto&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;

The evolution of purple bacteria, which do not produce or use oxygen but can tolerate it, enabled mats to colonize areas that locally had relatively high concentrations of oxygen, which is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abele2002ToxicOxygen&quot; /&gt;  Microbial mats would have been separated into oxidized and reduced layers, and this specialization would have increased their productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt; It may be possible to confirm this model by analyzing the isotope ratios of both carbon and sulfur in sediments laid down in shallow water.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;

The last major stage in the evolution of microbial mats was the appearance of [[cyanobacteria]], photsynthesizers which both produce and use oxygen. This gave undersea mats their typical modern structure: an oxygen-rich top layer of cyanobacteria; a layer of photsynthesizing purple bacteria that could tolerate oxygen; and oxygen-free, [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]-dominated lower layers of heterotrophic scavengers, mainly methane-emitting and sulfate-reducing organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;

It is estimated that the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1,000. All photosynthetic [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] require a [[reducing agent]], but the significance of oxygenic photosynthesis is that it uses [[water]] as a reducing agent, and water is much more plentiful than the geologically-produced reducing agents on which photosynthesis previously depended. The resulting increases in the populations of photosynthesizing bacteria in the top layers of microbial mats would have caused corresponding population increases among the [[chemotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] micro-organisms that inhabited the lower layers and which fed respectively on the by-products of the photosynthesizers and on the corpses and / or living bodies of the other mat organisms. These increases would have made microbial mats the planet's dominant ecosystems. From this point onwards life itself produced significantly more of the resources it needed than did geochemical processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoehlerBeboutMarais2001MicrobialMatsInProductionOfReducedGasesOnEarlyEarth&quot; /&gt;

Oxygenic photosynthesis in microbial mats would also have increased the free oxygen content of the earth's atmosphere, both directly by emitting oxygen and because the mats emitted molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), some of which would have escaped from the Earth's atmosphere before it could re-combine with free oxygen to form more water. Microbial mats thus played a major role in the evolution of organisms  which could first tolerate free oxygen and then use it as an energy source.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoehlerBeboutMarais2001MicrobialMatsInProductionOfReducedGasesOnEarlyEarth&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=The role of microbial mats in the production of reduced gases on the early Earth | author=Hoehler, T.M., Bebout, B.M., and Des Marais, D.J. | journal=Nature | volume=412 | pages=324–7 | date=19 July 2001 | doi=10.1038/35085554 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6844/full/412324a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it, but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen-adapted organisms&lt;ref name=&quot;Abele2002ToxicOxygen&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Toxic oxygen: The radical life-giver | author=Abele, D. | journal=Nature | volume=420 | issue=27 | date=7 November 2002 | doi=10.1038/420027a | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6911/full/420027a.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pages=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — for example anaerobic [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] produces a net yield of two [[molecule]]s of [[adenosine triphosphate]], cells' internal &quot;fuel&quot;, per molecule of [[glucose]], while [[aerobic respiration]] produces a net yield of 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://trc.ucdavis.edu/biosci10v/bis10v/week3/06aerobicrespirintro.html | title=Introduction to Aerobic Respiration | publisher=University of California, Davis | accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxygen#Build-up_in_the_atmosphere|oxygenation of the atmosphere]] was a prerequisite for the evolution of the more complex [[eukaryote]] type  of cell, from which all [[multicellular]] organisms are built.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=A molecular timescale of eukaryote evolution and the rise of complex multicellular life | author=Hedges, S.B., Blair, J.E, Venturi, M.L., and Shoe, J.L | journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology | issue=2 | doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-2 | date=28 January 2004 | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/2/abstract/ | accessdate=2008-07-14 | volume=4 | pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria have the most complete biochemical &quot;toolkits&quot; of all the mat-forming organisms: the photosynthesis mechanisms of both [[Green sulfur bacteria|green bacteria]] and purple bacteria; oxygen production; and the [[Calvin cycle]], which converts [[carbon dioxide]] and water into [[carbohydrate]]s and [[sugar]]s. It is likely that they acquired many of these sub-systems from existing mat organisms, by some combination of [[horizontal gene transfer]] and [[endosymbiosis]] followed by fusion. Whatever the causes, cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of the mat organisms and were well-adapted to strike out on their own both as floating mats and as the first of the [[phytoplankton]], which forms the basis of most marine [[food chain]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;

===Origin of eukaryotes ===
The time at which [[eukaryote]]s first appeared is still uncertain: there is reasonable evidence that fossils dated between {{ma|1600}} and {{ma|2100}} represent eukaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;

If such endosymbiosis was an important factor, microbial mats would have encouraged it. There are two possible variations of this scenario:
*The boundary between the oxygenated and oxygen-free zones of a mat would have moved up when photosynthesis shut down at night and back down when photosynthesis resumed after the next sunrise. Symbiosis between independent aerobic and anaerobic organisms would have enabled both to live comfortably in the zone that was subject to oxygen &quot;tides&quot;, and subsequent endosymbiosis would have made such partnerships more mobile.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;
*The initial partnership may have been between anaerobic archea that required [[hydrogen hypothesis|molecular hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and heterotrophic bacteria that produced it and could live both with and without oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;NisbetFowler1999ArchaeanMetabolicEvolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin W., and Müller, M. | title=The hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote |journal=Nature |volume=392 |issue=6671 |pages=37–41 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9510246 |doi=10.1038/32096 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6671/abs/392037a0.html;jsessionid=C6090FB2CDDA3DA3AD58956BF205BB18 | accessdate=2008-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cambrian substrate revolution===
In the Early Cambrian, however, organisms began to burrow vertically for protection or food, breaking down the microbial mats, and thus allowing water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface and kill the oxygen-intolerant micro-organisms in the lower layers. As a result of this [[Cambrian substrate revolution]], marine microbial mats are confined to environments in which burrowing is non-existent or negligible:&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt; very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which are uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats;&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005&gt;{{cite journal

===Current status===
Although the Cambrian substrate revolution opened up new niches for animals, it was not catastrophic for microbial mats — &lt;!-- 

but it did greatly reduce their extent

--&gt;micro-organisms account for over 99% of all living matter on Earth, and most of them are members of biofilm and microbial mat communities. These communities are still vital to the survival of life on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;KrumbeinBrehmEtAl2003BiofilmBiodictyonBiomatEtc&quot; /&gt;

==How microbial mats help paleontologists==
Most fossils preserve only the hard parts of organisms, e.g. shells. The rare cases where soft-bodied fossils are preserved (the remains of soft-bodied organisms and also of the soft parts of organisms for which only hard parts such as shells are usually found) are extremely valuable because they provide information about organisms that are hardly ever fossilized and much more information than is usually available about those for which only the hard parts are usually preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs2003RoleInFossilization&quot; /&gt; Microbial mats help to preserve soft-bodied fossils  by:
*Capturing corpses on the sticky surfaces of mats and thus preventing them from floating or drifting away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs2003RoleInFossilization&quot;&gt;{{ citation | author=Briggs, D.E.G. | contribution=The role of biofilms in the fossilization of non-biomineralized tissues | pages=281–290 | title=Fossil and Recent Biofilms: A Natural History of Life on Earth | editor=Krumbein, W.E., Paterson, D.M., and Zavarzin, G.A. | year=2003 | publisher=Kluwer Academic| isbn=1402015976 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s85eD_FubN4C&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22The+role+of+biofilms+in+the+fossilization+of+non-biomineralized+tissues%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3nj49SSygM&amp;sig=nU2sqjXjVb7XLUodqb3j88fGhUw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA281,M1 | accessdate=2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Physically protecting them from being eaten by scavengers and broken up by burrowing animals, and protecting fossil-bearing sediments from erosion. For example the speed of water current required to erode sediment bound by a mat is 30 - 20 times greater than the speed required to erode a bare sediment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs2003RoleInFossilization&quot; /&gt;
*Preventing or reducing decay both by physically screening the remains from decay-causing bacteria and by creating chemical conditions that are hostile to decay-causing bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs2003RoleInFossilization&quot; /&gt;
*Preserving tracks and burrows by protecting them from erosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs2003RoleInFossilization&quot; /&gt;  Many trace fossils date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them and thus improve paleontologists' estimates of when animals with these capabilities first appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seilacher1994CruzianaStratigraphy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, A. | year = 1994 | title = How valid is Cruziana Stratigraphy? | journal = International Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 83 | issue = 4

Bibliotheks-und Informationssystem der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Odenburg, pp. 97–105.&lt;/ref&gt;, evidenced in [[trace fossil]]s, is the diversification of [[Burrow|animal burrowing]] during the early [[Cambrian]] period. 

Before this &quot;widening of the behavioural repertoire&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;S. Conway Morris, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benthos|bottom-dwelling]] animals mainly grazed on the [[microbial mat]]s that lined the surface, crawling above or burrowing just below them. These microbial mats created a barrier between the water and the [[Substrate (marine biology)|sediment underneath]], which was less water-logged than modern sea-floors, and almost completely [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] (lacking in [[oxygen]]). As a result the substrate was inhabited by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]], whose emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) made the substrate toxic to most other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaileyEtAl2006MicrobiallyMediatedEnvironmentalInfluences&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Microbially-Mediated Environmental Influences on Metazoan Colonization of Matground Ecosystems: Evidence from the Lower Cambrian Harkless Formation | author=Bailey, J.V., Corsetti, F.A., Bottjer, D.J., and Marenco, K.N. | journal= Palaios| volume=21 |issue=3 | month=June | year=2006 | doi=10.2110/palo.2005-p05-51e | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.2110%2Fpalo.2005-p05-51e&amp;ct=1 | accessdate=2008-06-28 | pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Around the start of the Cambrian, organisms began to burrow vertically, forming a great diversity of different [[fossil]]isable burrow forms as they penetrated the sediment for protection or to feed.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These burrowing animals broke down the microbial mats, and thus allowed water and oxygen to penetrate a considerable distance below the surface. This restricted the sulfate-reducing bacteria and their H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S emissions to the deeper layers, making the upper layers of the sea-floor habitable for a much wider range of organisms. The upper level of the sea-floor became wetter and softer as it was constantly churned up by burrowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;

==Burrowing before the Cambrian==

[[Image:Ediacaran trace fossil.jpg|thumb|An Ediacaran trace fossil, made when an organism burrowed below a microbial mat.]]
The traces of organisms moving on and directly underneath the microbial mats that covered the Ediacaran sea floor are preserved from the [[Ediacaran period]], about {{Ma|565}}.  The only Ediacaran burrows are horizontal, on or just below the surface, and were made by animals which fed above the surface, but burrowed to hide from predators.&lt;ref name=Dzik2007/&gt; If these burrows are [[biogenic]] (made by organisms) they imply the presence of motile organisms with heads, which would probably have been [[bilateria|bilaterans]] (bilaterally symmetrical animals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Ediacaran burrows found so far imply simple behaviour, and the complex, efficient feeding traces common from the start of the Cambrian are absent.

Some simple pre-Cambrian horizontal traces could have been produced by large single-celled organisms; equivalent traces are produced by protists today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.cub.2008.10.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The early Cambrian diversification of burrow forms==

From the very start of the Cambrian period&lt;ref name=Gehling2001/&gt; (about {{Ma|542}}) many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to [[arthropod]]s, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard (although not necessarily mineralised&lt;!--is &quot;chitin&quot; being avoided?--&gt;) [[exoskeletons]].&lt;ref name=Jensen2003&gt;{{cite journal

| year=2003
| volume=43
| pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of burrowing==
===Feeding===
Many organisms burrow to obtain food, either in the form of other burrowing organisms, or organic matter.  The remains of planktonic organisms sink to the sea floor, providing a source of nutrition; if these organics are mixed into the sediment they can be fed upon.  However, it is possible that before the Cambrian, plankton were too small to sink, so there was no supply of organic carbon to the sea floor.&lt;ref name=Butterfield2001&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Butterfield, N.J.
 | year = 2001
 | title = Ecology and evolution of Cambrian plankton
 | journal = 
 | pages = 200–216
 | url = http://66.102.1.104/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=cache:9xeRu1SdF0QJ:www.earthscape.org/r3/ES14785/ch09.pdf+
 | accessdate = 2007-08-19
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it appears that organisms did not feed upon the sediment itself until after the Cambrian.&lt;Ref name=Butterfield200?&gt;&lt;!--I read this in a Butterfield paper today (1st July), but can't remember which one!!!  I'll hopefully come across it again presently. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchorage===
Many organisms dwelt within the substrate to protect themselves from being washed away by currents.{{Verify source|date=July 2008}}

===Protection===

Organisms also burrow to avoid predation.  [[Predation|Predatory behaviour]] first appeared over {{Ma|1000}}, but predation on large organisms appears to have first become significant shortly before the start of the Cambrian.  Precambrian burrows served a protective function, as the animals that made them fed above the surface; they evolved at the same time as other organisms began forming mineralised skeletons.&lt;ref name=Dzik2007/&gt;

==Enabling burrowing==
Microbial mats formed a blanket, cutting off the underlying sediments from the ocean water above.  This meant that the sediments were [[Anoxia|anoxic]], and [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{h2s}}) was abundant.  The free exchange of the pore waters with oxygenated ocean water was essential to make the sediments inhabitable. This exchange was made possible by the action of minute animals: too small to produce burrows of their own, this [[Fauna#Meiofauna|meiofauna]] inhabited the spaces between sand grains in the microbial mats.  Their [[bioturbation]]— movement that dislodged grains and disturbed the resistant biomats— broke them up, allowing water and chemicals to mix on both sides of the mat.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005/&gt;

==Effects of the revolution==
The Cambrian substrate revolution was a long and patchy process that proceeded at different rates in different locations throughout much of the [[Cambrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

| volume=37 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on ecosystems===
After the agronomic revolution, the [[microbial mat]]s that had covered the Ediacaran sea floor became increasingly restricted to a limited range of environments:
*Very harsh environments, such as hyper-saline lagoons or brackish estuaries, which were uninhabitable for the burrowing organisms that broke up the mats.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005/&gt;
*Rocky substrates which the burrowers could not penetrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;
*The depths of the oceans, where burrowing activity today is at a similar level to that in the shallow coastal seas before the revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;
Ironically, the first burrowers probably fed on the microbial mats, while burrowing underneath them for protection; this burrowing led to the downfall of the mats they were feeding on.&lt;ref name=Dzik2007&gt;{{The Rise and Fall of the Ediacaran Biota|Dzik, J|The Verdun Syndrome: simultaneous origin of protective armour and infaunal shelters at the Precambrian–Cambrian transition|405|414|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the revolution, bottom dwelling organisms fell into four categories:&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;
*&quot;mat encrusters&quot;, which were permanently attached to the mat;
*&quot;mat scratchers&quot;, which grazed the surface of the mat without destroying it;
*&quot;mat stickers&quot;, suspension feeders that were partially embedded in the mat; and
*&quot;undermat miners&quot;, which burrowed underneath the mat and fed on decomposing mat material.

The &quot;undermat miners&quot; appear to have died out by the middle of the [[Cambrian]] period.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005/&gt; &quot;Mat encrusters&quot; and &quot;mat stickers&quot; either died out or developed more secure [[holdfast|anchors]] that were specialised for soft or hard substrates. &quot;Mat scratchers&quot; were restricted to rocky substrates and the depths of the oceans, where both they and the mats could survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:OrdCrinoidHoldfasts.jpg| thumb | right | 200px |[[Crinoid]] holdfasts on a hard substrate from the Upper [[Ordovician]] of northern Kentucky.]]
Early [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[echinoderm]]s were mostly &quot;mat stickers&quot;. The [[helicoplacus|helicoplacoids]] failed to adapt to the new conditions and died out; the [[edrioasteroids]] and [[eocrinoid]]s survived by developing holdfasts for attachment to hard substrates, and stalks that raised their feeding apparatus above most of the debris that burrowers stirred up in the looser sea-floors. Mobile echinoderms ([[stylophoran]]s, [[homostelean]]s, [[homoiostelean]]s, and [[ctenocystoid]]s) were not significantly affected by the substrate revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt;

Early [[mollusc]]s appear to have grazed on microbial mats, so it is natural to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where the mats could survive. The earliest known fossils of [[monoplacophora]]n (&quot;single-plated&quot;) molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft subtrates in deep parts of the seas, although one [[genus]] lives on hard substrates at the edges of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately the oldest known fossils of [[polyplacophora]]ns (molluscs with multiple shell plates) are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with [[stromatolite]]s (stubby pillars bult by some types of microbial mat colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;BottjerEtAl2000CambrianSubstrateRevolution&quot; /&gt; No fossils have been found of [[aplacophora]]ns (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/inverts/mollusca/aplacophora.php | title=The Aplacophora | publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology | accessdate=2008-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaeontological significance===
The revolution put an end to the conditions which allowed [[Burgess shale type preservation|exceptionally preserved]] [[lagerstatte|fossil beds]] such as the [[Burgess shale]] to be formed.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005/&gt; The direct consumption of carcasses was relatively unimportant in reducing fossilisation,  compared to changes in sediments' chemistry, porosity, and microbiology, which made it difficult for the chemical gradients necessary for soft-tissue mineralisation to develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orr2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Post-Cambrian closure of the deep-water slope-basin taphonomic window | author= Orr, P.J., Benton, M.J., and Briggs, D.E.G. | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1130/G19193.1 | url=http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1130%2FG19193.1 | accessdate=2008-06-28 | journal= Geology| volume=31 | pages=769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just like microbial mats, environments which could produce this mode of fossilisation became increasingly restricted to harsher and deeper areas, where burrowers could not establish a foothold; as time progressed, the extent of burrowing increased sufficiently to effectively make this mode of preservation impossible.&lt;ref name=Orr2003/&gt;  Post-Cambrian lagerstatte of this nature are typically found in very unusual environments.

The rise in burrowing is of further significance, for burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile bottom-dwelling organisms.  This furthers palaeontologists' understanding of the early Cambrian, and provides an additional line of evidence to show that the [[Cambrian explosion]] represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact - even if its timing did not coincide directly with the Agronomic revolution.&lt;ref name=Seilacher2005/&gt;

The rise of burrowing represents such a fundamental change to the [[Paleoecology|ecosystem]], that the appearance of the complex burrow ''[[Trichophycus pedum]]'' is used to mark the base of the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name=Gehling2001&gt; though it has since been found in lower, technically &quot;Precambrian&quot;, strata.
*{{Cite doi | 10.1017/S001675680100509X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geochemical significance===

The increased level of bioturbation meant that sulfur, which is steadily supplied to the oceanic system from volcanoes and river runoff, was more readily oxidised - rather than being rapidly buried and sitting in its reduced form (sulfide), burrowing organisms continually exposed it to oxygen, allowing it to be oxidised to sulfate.   This activity is suggested to account for a sudden rise in sulfate concentration observed near the base of the Cambrian; this can be recorded in the geochemical record both by using {{d34S}} isotopic tracers, and by quantifying the abundance of the sulfate mineral [[gypsum]].&lt;ref name=Canfield2009&gt;{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0902037106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

As no major principles of [[Buddhism]] contradict it, many Buddhists tacitly accept the [[evolution|theory of evolution]]. Questions about the eternity or infinity of the universe at large are counted among the [[14 unanswerable questions]] which the Buddha maintained were counterproductive areas of speculation. As such, many Buddhists do not think about these kinds of questions as particularly meaningful or helpful from a religious perspective.  One does not need to know the origin of life, nor agree with the Buddha's position on scientific topics, in order to achieve [[bodhi|enlightenment]].  In the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], a potential follower asks the Buddha for an answer to the problem of [[cosmogony]]:
: In response, the Buddha said, “It is as if a man had been wounded by a poisoned arrow and when attended to by a physician were to say, ‘I will not allow you to remove this arrow until I have learned the caste, the age, the occupation, the birthplace, and the motivation of the person who wounded me.’ That man would die before having learned all this. In exactly the same way, anyone who should say, ‘I will not follow the teaching of the Blessed One until the Blessed One has explained all the multiform truths of the world’-that person would die before the Buddha had explained all this.”


The Buddha argued that there is no apparent rational necessity for the existence of a creator god because everything ultimately is created by mind. Belief in a creator is not necessarily addressed by a religion based on [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and Buddhism is generally accepting of modern scientific theories about [[Big bang|the formation of the universe]]. This can be argued either from the standpoint that it simply does not matter, or from an interpretation of the Agañña Sutta favoring the notion that it describes the basic concept of evolution.

==Aggañña Sutta==

In the [[Aggañña Sutta]], found in the [[Pali Canon]], the Buddha does appear to give a highly detailed answer to this issue. The Buddha, speaking to the monk Vasettha, a former [[Brahmin]], states the following:

:&quot;There comes a time, Vasettha, when, after the lapse of a long, long period, this world died. And when this happens, beings have mostly been reborn into the [[Buddhist cosmology#Ābhāsvara worlds|Realm of Radiance]] [as [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s]; and there they dwell, made of mind, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, traversing the air, continuing in glory; and thus they remain for a long, long period of time. There comes also a time, Vasettha, when sooner or later this world begins to re-evolve. When this happens, beings who had deceased from the World of Radiance usually come to life as humans...now at that time, all had become one world of water, dark, and of darkness that maketh blind. No moon nor sun appeared, no stars were seen, nor constellations, neither was night manifest nor day, neither months nor half-months, neither years nor seasons, neither female nor male. Beings were reckoned just as beings only. And to those beings, Vasettha, sooner or later after a long time, earth with its savours was spread out in the waters, even as a scum forms on the surface of boiled milky rice that is cooling, so did the earth appear.&quot;

Because the Buddha seems to present a model of cosmology wherein the universe expands and contracts over extremely long periods of time, this description has been found by some to be consistent with the [[expanding universe]] model and Big Bang. The Buddha seems to be saying here that the universe expands outward, reaches a stabilising point, and then reverts its motion back toward a central point resulting in its destruction, this process again to be repeated infinitely. Throughout this expanding and contracting process, the objects found within the universe undergo periods of development and change over a long stretch of time, according to the environment in which they find themselves. Following this passage above, the Buddha goes on to say that the &quot;beings&quot; he described in this paragraph become attached to an earthlike planet, get reborn there, and remain there for the duration of the life. As a consequence of this, physical characteristics change and evolutionary changes takes place. This is often interpreted as a very rough theory of [[evolution]]. Furthermore, the Aggañña Sutta presents water as pre-existent to earthlike planets, with the planet forming with water and the life moving from the water onto the earth. The Buddha does not talk about a specific earth, but about earthlike planets in general.

The Aggañña Sutta does raise an issue about the importance of the question; if the Buddha regards the answer as meaningless, why would he give a teaching on it? And if he does not regard the answer as meaningless, why did he not provide it to another person who asked? One of the answers could be that he gave the teaching to people who had a very fixed idea of the existence of the universe or tried to explain the creation seen on a relative level. The Buddha likened his teaching to a doctor's medicine to cure a patient's suffering. The medicine must be of the right content and right amount to the right patient at the right time. As such, there is no absolute truth as there is no single, absolute cure-all medicine fitting all patients.

A [[Charles_Darwin|Darwinian]] Demon&lt;ref&gt;Law, R. 1979 Optimal Life Histories under age-specific Predation. American Naturalist 114: 399-417.&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical [[organism]] that can maximize all aspects of [[Fitness_(biology)|fitness]] simultaneously and would exist if the [[evolution]] of [[species]] was entirely unconstrained. Such organisms would [[reproduction|reproduce]] directly after being born, produce the maximum number of offspring, and live indefinitely. Even though no such organisms exist, biologists use Darwinian Demons in thought experiments to understand different [[life history strategies]] among different organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Polaroid OneStep Express.jpg|thumb|right|Polaroid [[instant camera]]s have disappeared almost completely with the spread of [[digital photography]].]]
The notion of '''creative destruction''' is found in the writings of [[Mikhail Bakunin]],&lt;ref&gt; &quot;the passion for destruction is a creative passion&quot;, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany], Mikhail Bakunin, 1842&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and in [[Werner Sombart]]'s ''Krieg und Kapitalismus'' (War and Capitalism) (1913, p. 207), where he wrote: &quot;again out of destruction a new spirit of creativity arises&quot;. In ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'', the Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] popularized and used the term to describe the process of transformation that accompanies radical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=$200 Laptops Break a Business Model  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/technology/26spend.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |quote=Indeed, Silicon Valley may be one of the few places where businesses are still aware of the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who wrote about business cycles during the first half of the last century. He said the lifeblood of capitalism was “creative destruction.” Companies rising and falling would unleash innovation and in the end make the economy stronger.  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Schumpeter's vision of [[capitalism]], innovative entry by [[entrepreneurs]] was the force that sustained long-term [[economic growth]], even as it destroyed the value of established companies that enjoyed some degree of [[monopoly]] power.

==Theory and examples==
Companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries &amp;ndash; for example, [[Xerox]] in copiers&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.london.edu/mkyle/SMJ%20revision%20Sept%202004.pdf Surviving the Gales of Creative Destruction:
The Determinants of Product Turnover], John M. de Figueiredo &amp; Margaret K. Kyle, 12 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in instant photography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/Christiansandstrom/disruptive-innovation-and-the-bankruptcy-of-polaroid-presentation Disruptive Innovation And The Bankruptcy Of Polaroid], Chris Sandström, December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; have seen their [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs. [[Wal-Mart]] is a recent example of a company that has achieved a strong position in many markets, through its use of new inventory-management, marketing, and personnel-management techniques, using its resulting lower prices to compete with older or smaller companies in the offering of retail consumer products. Just as older [[behemoth]]s perceived to be juggernauts by their contemporaries (e.g., [[Montgomery Ward]], [[FedMart]], [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworths]]) were eventually undone by nimbler and more innovative competitors, Wal-Mart faces the same threat. Just as the [[cassette tape]] replaced the [[8-track]], only to be replaced in turn by the [[compact disc]], itself being undercut by [[MP3]] players, the seemingly dominant Wal-Mart may well find itself an antiquated company of the past. This is the process of creative destruction.

Other examples are the way in which online free newspaper sites such as ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and the ''[[National Review Online]]'' are leading to creative destruction of the traditional paper newspaper.  The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' announced in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://johngaynardcreativity.blogspot.com/2009/01/christian-science-monitor-is-to.html&lt;/ref&gt; that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition, but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition. The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' became online-only in March 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;pifrontpage&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Richman |authorlink= |coauthors=James, Andrea |title=Seattle P-I to publish last edition Tuesday |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/403793_piclosure17.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher= |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional French alumni networks, which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories, are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as [[Linkedin]] and [[Viadeo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://johngaynardcreativity.blogspot.com/2009/01/could-linkedin-and-viadeo-creatively.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, successful [[innovation]] is normally a source of temporary [[market power]], eroding the profits and position of old firms, yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants. Creative destruction is a powerful [[economic]] concept because it can explain many of the dynamics of industrial change: the transition from a [[competitive]] to a monopolistic market, and back again.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} It has been the inspiration of [[endogenous growth theory]] and also of [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard R. Nelson, Katherine Nelson ''Technology, institutions, and innovation systems''. [[Research Policy]] 31 (2002), p. 265-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative destruction can hurt. Layoffs of workers with obsolete working skills can be one price of new innovations valued by consumers. Though a continually innovating economy generates new opportunities for workers to participate in more creative and productive enterprises (provided they can acquire the necessary skills), creative destruction can cause severe hardship in the short term, and in the long term for those who cannot acquire the skills and work experience.

==History==
The expression &quot;creative destruction&quot; was brought in to the economic discourse via [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]]'s book, ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'', first published in 1942. The most likely source can be found in his 1939 book ''Business Cycles''. Here the Western world first learned about [[Nikolai Kondratieff]] and his [[Kondratiev wave|long-wave]] cycle. These cycles, Schumpeter believed, were caused by innovations.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

[[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]]'s contributions are not generally included in most undergraduate economic textbooks, which focus instead on the theories of [[perfect competition]] and static [[supply and demand]], models which [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] claimed had little relevance to the real world.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

In 1992, the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by [[Philippe Aghion]] and Peter Howitt in their paper &quot;A Model of Growth through Creative Destruction,&quot; published in ''[[Econometrica]]''.

In 1995, [[Harvard Business School]] authors [[Richard L. Nolan]] and [[David C. Croson]] released ''Creative Destruction:  A Six-Stage Process for Transforming the Organization.''  The book advocated [[downsizing]] to free up slack resources, which could then be reinvested to create [[competitive advantage]].

More recently, the idea of &quot;creative destruction&quot; was utilized by Max Page in his 1999 book, ''The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900-1940.''  The book traces [[Manhattan]]'s constant reinvention, often at the expense of preserving a concrete past. Describing this process as &quot;creative destruction,&quot; Page describes the complex historical circumstances, economics, social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in Manhattan's cityscape.

==Alternative name==
Per the following text, this process is also known as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]]'s Gale:

{{quote|The opening up of new markets and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as [[US Steel]] illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one ... [The process] must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.|Joseph Schumpeter|''The Process of Creative Destruction'', 1942}}

==Media reflections of creative destruction==

The film ''[[Other People's Money]]'' provides contrasting views of creative destruction, presented in two speeches regarding the takeover of a publicly-traded wire and cable company in a small New England town. One speech is by a [[corporate raider]], and the other is given by the company CEO, who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mackinac.org/9170&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The discovery of [[nylon-eating bacteria]] has been used by critics of [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]], in both print articles and on websites, to challenge creationist claims. These bacteria could produce  novel [[enzyme]]s that allowed them to feed on by products of nylon manufacture that had not existed prior to the invention of [[nylon]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt; Kinoshita, S., Kageyama, S., Iba, K., Yamada, Y. and Okada, H. Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of ε-aminocapronoic acid by Achromobacter guttatus K172, Agric. Biol. Chem. 116, 547-551 (1981), FEBS 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and critics of creationism have stated that this contradicted creationist claims that no new information could be added to a genome by [[mutation]], and that proteins were too complex to evolve through a process of mutation and [[natural selection]]. Creationists have posted responses to these challenges on their own websites, which have in turn generated more responses from their critics.

==Critics of creationism ==
The issue was first raised by critics of creationism such as the [[National Center for Science Education]], and New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) who stated that research refutes claims made by creationists and [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/4661_issue_16_volume_5_number_2__4_10_2003.asp#New%20Proteins%20Without%20God's%20Help New Proteins Without God's Help] &amp;ndash; William M. Thwaites&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug]&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were that random [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] can never add new information to a [[genome]] and that the odds against a useful new [[protein]], such as an enzyme, arising through a process of random mutation would be prohibitively high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CB/CB101_2.html Claim CB101_2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CB/CB102.html (CB102)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Dave Thomas (physicist)|Dave Thomas]], the President of NMSR, has stated that [[gene duplication]] and [[frame-shift mutation]]s were powerful sources of random mutation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Dave Thomas's ''New Mexicans for Science and Reason'' article about nylon eating bacteria]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, in response to comments by creationists such as Don Batten, NMSR has stated that it was these mutations that gave rise to nylonase, even if the genes were part of a [[plasmid]] as suggested by Batten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm#update update] to ''New Mexicans for Science and Reason'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationists==
Creationists have cited analyses posted by Don Batten, described as a plant biologist and tropical fruit expert on the [[Answers in Genesis]] website, that cited scientific research that showed the genes involved were on a [[plasmid]], and stated that the phenomenon is evidence that plasmids in bacteria are a designed feature intended to allow bacteria to adapt easily to new food sources or cope with toxic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v17/i3/bacteria.asp Answers in Genesis article on nylon eating bacteria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligent Design==
[[MSNBC]] published an editorial from science writer Ker Than that stated that the [[evolution]] of the enzymes, known as [[nylonase]], produced by nylon-eating bacteria were a compelling argument against the claim made by intelligent design proponents that [[specified complexity]] required an intelligent designer, since nylonase function was both specified and complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/ Why scientists dismiss 'intelligent design'], Ker Than, [[MSNBC]], Sept. 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligent design proponent [[William Dembski]] posted a response that questioned whether the genetic changes that produced nylonase were complex enough to be considered specified complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/why-scientists-should-not-dismiss-intelligent-design/ Why Scientists Should NOT Dismiss Intelligent Design by William Dembski]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mergefrom|Averageness|date=December 2007}}
'''Koinophilia''' is a term used by [[biology|biologist]] Johan Koeslag, meaning that when sexual creatures seek a mate, they prefer that mate not to have any unusual, peculiar or deviant features. Stated differently, sexual creatures prefer mates with a preponderance of common or average features.

[[Natural selection]] results, over the course of generations, in beneficial (or [[Fitness (biology)|&quot;fit&quot;]]) features replacing their disadvantageous counterparts. This is the fundamental force which drives [[evolution]]. Thus, natural selection causes beneficial features to become increasingly more common with each generation, while the disadvantageous features become increasingly rare. A sexual creature, therefore, wishing to mate with a fit partner, would be expected to avoid individuals sporting unusual features, while being especially attracted to those individuals displaying a predominance of common or [[Averageness|average features]]. This is termed &quot;koinophilia&quot;. It has, as an important side effect, that mates displaying mutant features (the result of a genetic [[mutation]]) are also avoided. This, in itself, is also advantageous, because the vast majority of mutations are disadvantageous. Because it is impossible to judge whether a new mutation is beneficial or not, koinophilic creatures will avoid them all with equal determination, even if this means avoiding the very occasional beneficial mutation. Thus, koinophilia, although not perfect or infallible in its ability to distinguish [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] from unfit mates, remains, on average, the best strategy when [[Sexual selection|choosing a mate]]. It will be right far more often than it will be wrong. Even when it is wrong, a koinophilic choice always ensures that the offspring will inherit a suite of  thoroughly tried and tested features.

==Introduction==
This [[Sexual selection|mating strategy]], was first referred to as ''koinophilia'' by Johan H. Koeslag&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 1990&quot; /&gt;, from the Greek, ''koinos'', meaning &quot;the usual&quot; or &quot;common&quot;, and ''philos'', meaning &quot;fondness&quot; or &quot;love&quot;. It was independently identified in humans by Judith Langlois,&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990&quot;&gt;LANGLOIS, J.H. &amp; ROGGMAN, L. (1990). Attractive faces are only average.

New York: Nova Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the average of two human faces was more attractive than either of the faces from which that average was derived. The more faces (of the same gender and age) that were used in the [[Averageness|averaging process]] the more attractive and appealing the average face became.

Sex is, fundamentally, the exchange of genetic material ([[DNA]]) between individuals. During such an exchange, it is obviously in a sexual creature's best interests for the DNA that it (or its offspring) gains through the exchange to be of at least the same quality as its own, or better. Sexual creatures would therefore be expected to be choosey about their sexual partners. They should prefer [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] partners (with good DNA) over unfit partners (with poor DNA). However, [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is something that can only be recognized in retrospect. It is, ''by definition'', the relative propensity to produce offspring and grand-offspring. At any one moment it is therefore impossible to predict which inherited [[phenotype|phenotypic features]] (i.e. the visible physical and behavioral effects of different parts of the DNA) are fitter than their alternatives.

[[Image:Sex B.gif|right|thumb|400px|The evolution of nose color in reindeer. The numbers on the left denote generation number; the arrows depict how the relevant DNA is copied from one generation to the next.]]
Thus, if, in the highly schematic diagram on the right, the white, blue, yellow, and red dots in generation 1 represent (imaginary) alternative nose colors in reindeer, then, in generation 1, it is totally impossible to even hazard a guess as to which color is the best for a reindeer's nose. Even if you knew every nose's dimensions, and physical and functional properties in full, it would still not indicate which one is the fittest of the four. That will only be revealed in several generations' time, because, regardless of how well the reindeer can smell, or breathe, or nuzzle in the snow with a particular nose, the ultimate and ''only'' test of fitness is whether that nose allows the bearer of that nose to breed better than the bearers of alternative nose colors.  Thus, after 4 generations there can be no doubt that red is selectively more advantageous than any of the other nose colors (even if, for instance, a red nose does not function as a nose at all, but appears, instead, as &quot;cute&quot; to humans, with the result that red-nosed reindeers are never slaughtered for food, but are pampered, and protected by humans.)

Thus, it is only possible to tell which phenotypic features have proven themselves to be fit over the ''past'' several generations. If a given feature is common, and its alternatives are rare, then it is a fairly good bet that the common feature is fitter than any of the others (or, has been up until now). This is the basis on which a koinophilic choice of a sexual mate is made.

There are, however, two other ways in which a feature can become more common than its alternatives. The first comes about through [[genetic drift]]. This only happens in small populations (e.g. on a small island, in a totally isolated mountain valley, or following a mass extinction) where random events can cause the loss of a fit feature, leaving a less fit alternative to become the dominant [[phenotype]]. Genetic drift is an important evolutionary force which ''might'', for instance, explain why humans have lost their fur. The lack of fur does not seem to impart any advantage over the other mammals, and is therefore unlikely to have arisen through natural selection. But once it became established as the norm (through genetic drift), koinophilia would then tend to maintain that feature. Koinophilia cannot distinguish between commonness caused by natural selection and commonness caused by genetic drift, with the result that modern humans would not be sexually attracted to a person covered in a thick coat of fur (like a bear or chimpanzee), regardless of what caused humans to become the &quot;Naked Ape&quot; in the first place.

The second way in which a feature can become common without being fitter than its alternative forms comes about when one gender (e.g. the females of the species) develops a preference for, say, a [[Sexual dimorphism|gaudy tail]] in the other gender. That will cause gaudy tails to become more common in the males, even though gaudy tails are not to their advantage (see the [[Handicap principle|&quot;Handicap principle&quot;]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi, A.]] (1975) Mate selection - a selection for a handicap.

ISBN 0-19-852685-7.&lt;/ref&gt; summarised below). However, the preference that the females have for the gaudy tails has to have an advantage or it would not have become the norm in that species. In fact, the combination of the preference in the one gender and its disadvantageous target in the other gender has to be advantageous overall for it to persist. If it is not, natural selection will eliminate it. Viewed in this light, the commonness of the peacock's tail among male peacocks is due to the simple operation of natural selection making fit features (or, in this case, a fit combination of features) more common than their less fit counterparts. It is therefore, in reality, not an alternative method of attaining commonness.

[[Image:Pfau imponierend.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A peacock's magnificent, but impractical, tail might have arisen through a number of evolutionary mechanisms, including genetic drift (see text). Once it became the norm, however, it would have, from then on, been maintained by koinophilia, whether the original reason for the gaudy tail was still valid or not.]]

If natural selection is, overall, a more pervasive force than [[genetic drift]], then{{Fact|date=April 2009}} commonness will denote fitness very much more often than it does not. That, in turn, implies{{Fact|date=April 2009}} that koinophilia is likely to be widespread amongst sexual creatures. It is, in fact, the only{{Fact|date=April 2009}} form of [[Sexual selection|mate choice]] which relies on the direct effects of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] itself, instead of on a surrogate indicator of fitness. For instance, a gaudy peacock's tail might originally have provided proof (to the peahens) that the bearer of such a wasteful, metabolically costly, and aerodynamically disastrous tail must be very fit if he can remain healthy despite his [[Handicap principle|handicap]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi, A.]] (1975) Mate selection - a selection for a handicap. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' '''53''', 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi, A.]] (1977) The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle).

ISBN 0-19-852685-7.&lt;/ref&gt; However the gaudy tail is a surrogate indicator of fitness. If females prefer males with gaudy tails then that is what they will get: males with gaudy tails. [[Natural selection]] will then tend, over time, to reduce the effect of the handicap as males with beautiful tails which cause them a minimum of inconvenience replace the males with tails that are genuine handicaps. The link between the gaudy tail and fitness is then broken. In other words, the tail has become a fake indicator of fitness. Commonness can not be faked in this way. It is natural selection's ultimate, and indeed ''only'', stamp of fitness.  It would, therefore, be extraordinary if sexual creatures were not, in the main, dedicated koinophiliacs.

==Physical attractiveness==
{{main|Averageness}}

In keeping with these theoretical considerations, humans clearly find young average faces the most attractive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrett et al. 1994&quot;&gt; PERRETT D.I.

Effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness. ''Nature (Lond)''  '''394''', 884-887&lt;/ref&gt; However, Perrett ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrett et al. 1994&quot;/&gt; found that both men and women found a slightly off-average female face the most attractive from a wide range of women's faces with neutral expressions and identical hairstyles. When the non-average features were slightly exaggerated the face was judged more attractive still. Close examination of the photos in Perrett, May and Yoshikawa's paper&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrett et al. 1994&quot;/&gt; shows, in fact, that the exaggerated face looks younger than the average face (composed of women's faces aged 22-46 years). The differences are, however, very small, and, to many people, not immediately obvious. Since the same results were obtained with Japanese subjects, these findings are probably culture independent, and would indicate that people generally find [[youthfulness|''youthful'']]  average female faces sexually the most attractive,&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990&quot;/&gt; as expected.

==Speciation and &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot;==
{{main|Speciation|Punctuated equilibrium}}

===The evolutionary problem===

[[Image:pinkflamingos.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The striking uniformity of the outward appearances of all the adult members of a species is a great evolutionary mystery.]]
A major evolutionary problem has been how the continuous process of [[evolution]] produces the morphologically discontinuous groups labeled [[species]]. Thus, there are lions, leopards, cheetahs and lynxes on the African savannah, each markedly different from the other, with no intermediate forms, or gradations in appearance going from, for instance, lions at one extreme to leopards at the other. Although various processes of [[speciation]] have long been recognized (e.g. [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[peripatric speciation|peripatric]], [[parapatric speciation|parapatric]], [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]]),&lt;ref name= &quot;Coyne, 1992&quot;&gt;COYNE, J.A. (1992). Genetics and speciation. ''Nature (Lond)'' '''335''', 511-515&lt;/ref&gt; they do not explain why the process is almost universal and very prominent among sexual creatures, while it is often conspicuously absent among asexual creatures. Asexual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation in form (often in many different directions) that evolution is expected to produce, making their classification into &quot;species&quot; (more correctly &quot;morphospecies&quot;) very difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koeslag, 1990&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maynard Smith, 1983&quot;&gt;MAYNARD SMITH, J. (1983). The genetics of stasis and punctuation. ''Ann. rev. Genet.''  '''17''', 11-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clapham et al. 1952&quot;&gt;CLAPHAM, A.R., TUTIN, T.G., WARBURG, E.F. (1952). ''Flora of the British Isles.''  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant, 1971&quot;&gt;GRANT, V. (1971). ''Plant speciation'' New York:Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Zebra Botswana edit02.jpg|thumb|left|400px|All the individual members of any given species generally look remarkably alike.]]
In sexual species, the canalization of the entire [[phenotype]] (i.e. the uniformity of all the individuals' appearances within a species) is both striking and extraordinary. Most people if their bungalow in an African game reserve was invaded by a vervet monkey, and then again a day or two later, would not know whether they were seeing the same animal again, or, in fact, another member of the same species. Even the camp attendants, who are seeing these animals on a daily basis, would not be able to distinguish between the individual members of the troop. Similarly, an ornithologist studying behavior in a flock of birds can only distinguish between the individuals if they have been fitted with individualized combinations of colored bands on their legs. In fact, for most persons, if you have seen one member of a species, then you have seen them all. So much so, that an illustration of just a single individual (or of a single male and a single female) in a field guide or encyclopedia usually suffices to describe, in minute and absolute detail, all the adult members of a species. Consider, on the other hand, the wide variety of dogs that humans have bred over the past 100 -200 years or so. There are breeds with no fur at all, and others with extra thick coats; there are long-legged greyhounds and stubby-legged dachshund; there are long snouted Afghan hounds and stub nosed pugs and bull dogs; and so it goes on - great Danes and Chihuahuas; loose skinned dogs and tight skinned dogs. That all of these breeds could have been derived in such a short space of time implies that all of this enormous variation was either already latently present in the original domestic dog population, or that viable mutations (particularly for changes in coat color and body proportions) are very common. This, in turn, implies that evolution has an enormous amount of raw material, on hand as it were, to work with. The slightest change of circumstances would, therefore, be expected to produce a change in [[phenotype]]. This is indeed what happens in asexual creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maynard Smith, 1983&quot;&gt;MAYNARD SMITH, J. (1983) The genetics of stasis and punctuation. ''Ann. rev. Genet.''  '''17''', 11-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clapham et al. 1952&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant, 1971&quot;&gt;GRANT, V. ''Plant speciation'' New York:Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual creatures, however, seem to vigorously resist these changes, down to even the most trivial of phenotypic features.

[[Image:Species 01a.gif|right|thumb|300px|Speciation poses a &quot;2-dimensional&quot; problem. The phenotypic discontinuities between existing species represent the &quot;horizontal dimension&quot; of the problem. The succession of fossil species represent the &quot;vertical dimension&quot;.]] This is, however, only one aspect of what is almost certainly a two-dimensional problem. The &quot;horizontal&quot; dimension refers to the almost complete absence of transitional forms between present-day species (e.g. lions, leopards, cheetahs and lynxes). The &quot;vertical&quot; dimension concerns the fossil record. Palaeontological species are frequently remarkably stable over extremely long periods of geological time, despite continental drift, major climate changes, and mass extinctions. Extreme examples of evolutionary conservatism (or [[Punctuated equilibrium|&quot;evolutionary stasis&quot;]]) include the [[Coelacanth]] which has been in place since the middle of the Devonian, 410 million years ago, the [[Horseshoe crab]] which has hardly changed in the past 350-400 million years, [[cockroach]]es which have existed for 300-350 million years, [[crocodile]]s which have changed very little since the time of the dinosaurs, and the [[Xenopus]] frog of which 90 million year-old fossil remains have been found. When phenotypic change does occur, it tends to be abrupt in geological terms, again producing phenotypic gaps, but now between successive species, which then often co-exist for considerable periods of time. Standard evolutionary theory predicts &quot;[[gradualism]]&quot;, meaning that creatures are expected to evolve gradually, and more or less continuously, from one species into another. The fossil record, though open to different interpretations (see [[Evolution]]), does not seem to support this prediction. It suggests that evolution occurs in bursts, interspersed by long periods of stasis (i.e. by means of [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;ELDREDGE, N., GOULD, S.J., (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp &quot;Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism&quot;] In SCHOPF, T.J.M., ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82-115. Reprinted in ELDREDGE, N. (1985) ''Time frames''. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). Why this is so, has been one of evolution's great mysteries.

===The solution===

Koinophilia could explain both the horizontal and vertical manifestations of speciation, and why it usually involves the entire external phenotype.&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 1995&quot;&gt;KOESLAG, J.H. (1995). On the engine of speciation. ''J. theor. Biol.''  '''177''', 401-409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 1990&quot; /&gt; Since, by definition, fit [[phenotype|traits]] replace less fit traits each fit trait tends to become more common and ultimately the dominant phenotype, while the maladaptive traits become increasingly rare. Sexual creatures would therefore be expected to prefer mates sporting predominantly common features, while avoiding mates with unusual, unfamiliar, fringe, or extreme attributes. This is termed koinophilia. It causes common features to become more common still, and at a rate that exceeds that which would be driven by natural selection alone. Since it affects the entire external phenotype, the members of an interbreeding group will soon all begin to look alike, and noticeably different from other interbreeding groups. Any individual from one interbreeding group who wanders into another interbreeding group will now be immediately recognizable as morphologically different, and will, therefore, be discriminated against during the mating season. This koinophilia-induced reproductive isolation might thus be the first crucial step in the development of, ultimately, molecular biological, physiological, behavioral, and anatomical barriers to hybridization, and thus, ultimately, full specieshood. Koinophilia will thereafter defend that species phenotype against invasion by unusual or unfamiliar forms (which might arise by immigration or mutation), and thus be a paradigm of [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]] (or the &quot;vertical&quot; aspect of the speciation problem.&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 1995&quot;&gt;KOESLAG, J.H. (1995). On the engine of speciation. ''J. theor Biol'' '''177''', 401-409&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 1990&quot; /&gt;), and [[stabilizing selection]].

==The evolution of cooperation==
{{main|Co-operation (evolution)}}

===Definition of cooperation===

Cooperation is any group behavior that benefits the individuals more than if they were to act as independent agents. There is however a second, very important, corollary to cooperation: it can always be exploited by selfish individuals who benefit even more by not taking part in the group activity, yet reaping its benefits. It is for this reason that [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Koeslag, 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 2003&quot;/&gt; poses an evolutionary problem. An extreme example was described by Wynne-Edwards&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1962&quot;&gt;WYNNE-EDWARDS, V.C. (1962). ''Animal Dispersion in Relation to Social Behaviour'' Edinburgh:Oliver &amp; Boyd &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1964&quot;&gt;WYNNE-EDWARDS, V.C. (1964). Population control in animals.''Scientific American'' '''211 (2)''', 68-74&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.  He described a gannetry on [[Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve|Cape St Mary]] on the Newfoundland coast. It consisted of two adjacent cliffs on which the [[Northern Gannet|gannets]] roosted at night. The birds that roosted on Cliff 1 mated, built nests and raised chicks. The birds that roosted on Cliff 2, despite being adult, and of both sexes, did not mate, build nests  or raise chicks, unless a vacancy arose on Cliff 1. A pair of birds would then move from Cliff 2 to Cliff 1, and start breeding. The obvious benefit of this behavior was that it limited population size, thereby ensuring that everyone had enough to eat, even in the long-term. It had the additional benefit that should an epidemic or inclement weather  wipe out a large portion of the colony, there would always be enough spare birds to fill the vacancies created by the disaster on Cliff 1. The population could thus be restored within a very short space of time.

===The evolutionary problem===

This observation caused a major controversy in biological circles because it seemed [[Group selection|evolutionarily impossible]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams|WILLIAMS, G.C.]] (1972) ''Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought''. Princetown UP. ISBN 0-691-02357-3 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; WILLIAMS, G.C. (1986) ''Evolution Through Group Selection''. Blackwell. ISBN 0-632-01541-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Smith|MAYNARD SMITH, J.]] (1964) Group selection and kin selection ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature (Lond)]]'' 201:1145–1147&lt;/ref&gt;. Imagine a mutant bird on Cliff 2 which, because of its mutation, was blind to the convention that (s)he should not breed on Cliff 2. Imagine that it found a mate equally unconcerned about the convention, and that the two of them set about raising chicks either on Cliff 2, or on a convenient ledge nearby. Since this unusual behavior is due to a genetic mutation, the resultant chicks would feel equally unbound by the convention that only birds that can be accommodated on Cliff 1 may breed.  Thus the grand-offspring of the first mutant pair would behave similarly, as would the great-grand-offspring. If, for ease of calculation, only half of the colony is normally accommodated on Cliff 1, then each normal bird has, on average, a 50% chance of breeding. The mutants, on the other hand, have a 100% chance of breeding. They are therefore twice as &quot;fit&quot; as the normal birds, meaning that the mutation will spread extremely rapidly. Within a very short space of time, it would replace its normal counterpart. In biological jargon, the normal cooperative behavior is &quot;[[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily unstable]]&quot;; it has no evolutionary defense against selfish mutants.

[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious  prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils. This poses an evolutionary problem, as [[natural selection]] only rewards immediate, short-term, strictly selfish interests,&lt;ref name=&quot;dawkins&quot;&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|DAWKINS, R.]] (1976). ''The Selfish Gene'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and has no long-term goals, or &quot;good for the species&quot;  plans.&lt;ref&gt;MAYR, E. (1988). ''Toward a New Philosophy of Biology''. pp. 95-109. Cambridge Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. ISBN 0-674-89665-3&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although this is an extreme example, it illustrates the evolutionary conundrum posed by any form of cooperative behavior. The selfish individuals who do not join the hunting pack and its incumbent dangers but nevertheless share the spoils, might be only 5-10% fitter than the cooperative individuals, but that does not matter. That extra 5% fitness will eventually result in the selfish mutation replacing its cooperative counterpart. Once the mutation has taken over from the normal gene, everyone is at a disadvantage compared to the original (cooperative) condition. Though this might seem extraordinary, it is nevertheless an inevitable evolutionary trap from which there is no obvious way of escape.

===Game Theory solutions===

The problem has been widely discussed in biology, because, despite these theoretical predictions (that cooperation is evolutionarily unstable), cooperative behavior is widespread in nature. The problem is most commonly addressed in &quot;[[Game theory|Game Theory]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Smith|MAYNARD SMITH, J.]] (1973).  The logic of animal conflict. ''Nature (Lond.)'' '''246''', 15-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MAYNARD SAMITH. J. (1974).  The theory of games and the evolution of conflict. ''J. theor. Biol.''  '''47''', 209--221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigmund, 1993&quot;&gt; [[Karl Sigmund|SIGMUND, K.]] (1993). ''Games of Life. Explorations in ecology evolution and behaviour.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  terms, which have led to important insights and understanding of  cooperative behavior and how it might be evolutionarily stabilized. An [[Chicken (game)|example]] is the following. The males of many species defend and fight for territories during the mating season. If all these encounters were full scale battles, then it might turn out that, for the average male, the loss in fitness due to injuries is greater than the gains in fitness from securing a territory and therefore a mate. If this is the case, then Game Theory predicts that inter-male squabbles should be settled through the observance of one or other non-violent convention, while reserving full scale battles only for those occasions when the convention is broken by one or other party. In other words it is [[tit-for-tat]]. The convention then becomes an &quot;[[Evolutionarily stable strategy]]&quot; because the individuals who disregard the convention suffer, on average, heavier losses in fitness than the individuals who adhere to the convention.

[[Image:Speckled Wood butterfly male.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Male speckled wood butterflies (''Pararge aegeria'') defend sunlit patches on the forest floor, where they await females. They are regularly challenged by other males who descend from the forest canopy, but the current owner of the sun-patch always repels the challenger, usually without a physical fight. If the owner is artificially removed and replaced by a recently defeated challenger, the new resident wins the next contest between the two, even if his ownership has not lasted longer than a few seconds. &lt;ref name=&quot;davies&quot;&gt;DAVIES, N.B. (1978). Territorial defence in the speckled wood butterfly (''Pararge aegeria''), the resident always wins. ''Anim. Behav.'' '''26''', 138-147.&lt;/ref&gt;]] This is indeed what is observed in nature. &lt;ref name=&quot;davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Eibl, 1961&quot;&gt; EIBL-EIBESFELDT, I, (1961). The fighting behavior of animals. ''Scientific American'' '''205 (6)''', 112-123&lt;/ref&gt; The rule that is most commonly followed in most species is that squabbles are settled by the convention that the current owner of the territory always wins, usually without a physical fight.  This, indeed, solves the original problem, but raises a new one. If the owner always wins when challenged, then why challenge? The &quot;game&quot; has now degenerated into the [[tic-tac-toe]] level of pointlessness. (The Game Theory prediction is that tic-tac-toe is a game not worth pursuing as it has only one stable end-point: an endless series of draws.)

A &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; strategy does not always lead to pointless &quot;games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981&quot;&gt;AXELROD, R. HAMILTON, W.D. (1981).

There is, for instance, no satisfactory explanation as to why individuals should show fear, submission, or embarrassment.&lt;ref name= &quot;Krebs 1978&quot;&gt;KREBS, J.R. &amp; DAWKINS, R. (1978) Animal signals: mind-reading and manipulation, In ''Behavioural Ecology: an evolutionary approach'' 2nd ed., J. R. Krebs and N. B. Davies, editors. Blackwell. Oxford, pp:380-402.&lt;/ref&gt; A selfish individual would be expected to bluff about such inner feelings, with Game Theory predicting that it is probably best to remain &quot;poker faced&quot; at all times.&lt;ref name= &quot;Krebs 1978&quot;/&gt; Yet the [[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals|expressions of the emotions]] are essential in a cooperative, sociable community, as are hierarchies, conventions, and rituals,&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Lorenz|LORENZ, K.]] (1961). ''King Solomon's Ring''. Translated by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. London:Methuen ISBN 0-416-53860-6&lt;/ref&gt; which remain evolutionary mysteries.

===The Koinophilic solution===

The problem with cooperation is that although a group of cooperative individuals is fitter than an equivalent group of selfish individuals, selfish individuals interspersed amongst a community of cooperators are fitter than their hosts. This means they raise, on average, more offspring than their hosts, and will therefore ultimately replace them.

If, however, the selfish individuals are ostracized, and rejected as mates, because of their deviant and unusual behavior, then their evolutionary advantage becomes an [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMD-491BYXG-5&amp;_coverDate=10%2F07%2F2003&amp;_alid=109914822&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=6932&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000032099&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=613892&amp;md5=307073e49eb8b5c28621efc7fea4d8fb evolutionary liability]. Cooperation in all of its very many forms then becomes [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Koeslag, 1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Koeslag, 2003&quot; /&gt; Sociability, social conventions, ritualistic behavior, expressions of the emotions, and other forms of communication between individuals, all essential ingredients for full cooperativity, can all be similarly [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stabilized]] by koinophilia.

Thus, whether it is a matter of joining the hunting pack, respecting the rules governing contests over territories, &lt;ref name= &quot;Eibl, 1961&quot;/&gt; or gannets adhering to a convention which permits breeding on only one of two adjacent cliffs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1962&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1964&quot;&gt;WYNNE-EDWARDS, V.C. (1964). Population control in animals. ''Scientific American'' '''211 (2)''', 68-74&lt;/ref&gt; koinophilia vigorously defends all of these practices against extinction at the hands of selfish, antisocial or nonconformist mutants.

===Consequences===

If all of these practices are rendered evolutionarily stable by koinophilia, then the purposes they might serve need not always be explained only in terms of selfish interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawkins&quot;&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|DAWKINS, R.]] (1976). ''The Selfish Gene'' Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This represents koinophilia's most controversial consequence or conclusion.

Thus, for example,  it becomes, surprisingly, a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] (or, more specifically, a [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|Modern Evolutionary Synthetic]]) feasibility that, as David Crews &lt;ref name= &quot;Crews 1979&quot;&gt;CREWS, D (1979). The hormonal control of behavior in a lizard. ''Scientific American'' '''241 (2)''', 158-165&lt;/ref&gt; and V.C Wynne-Edwards&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1962&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1964&quot;/&gt; have suggested, the ceremonial challenging of territory ownership,&lt;ref name= &quot;Eibl, 1961&quot;/&gt; or the massed formation flying and dusk choruses of starlings (and many other species) at their roosts&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1962&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1964&quot;/&gt; might serve to control  population size. When there is a mismatch between population size and the number of available territories the frequency of contests is likely to increase, or the dusk choruses to become excessively raucous. When this occurs, depending on the species, the females' secretion of pituitary [[gonadotropin]]s is inhibited,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1962&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name= &quot;Crews 1979&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne-Edwards, 1964&quot;/&gt; inducing infertility and thus a reduction in population size.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''small shelly fauna''' or '''small shelly fossils''', abbreviated to '''SSF''', are [[biomineralization|mineralized]] [[fossil]]s, many only a few millimetres long, with a nearly continuous record from the latest stages of the [[Ediacaran]] to the end of the Early [[Cambrian]] [[period (geology)|period]]. They are very diverse, and there is no formal definition of &quot;small shelly fauna&quot; or &quot;small shelly fossils&quot;.  Almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as [[trilobite]]s. Since most SSFs were preserved by being covered quickly with [[phosphate]] and this method of preservation is mainly limited to the Late Ediacaran and Early Cambrian periods, the animals that made them may actually have arisen earlier and persisted after this time span.

Some of the fossils represent the entire [[skeleton]]s of small organisms, including the mysterious ''[[Cloudina]]'' and some snail-like [[mollusc]]s. However, the bulk of the fossils are fragments or disarticulated remains of larger organisms, including [[sponges]], [[mollusc]]s, slug-like [[halkieriid]]s, [[brachiopods]], [[echinoderm]]s,  and [[onychophora]]n-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of [[arthropod]]s.

One of the early explanations for the appearance of the SSFs - and therefore the evolution of mineralized [[skeleton]]s - suggested a sudden increase in the ocean's concentration of [[calcium]].  However, many SSFs are constructed of other minerals, such as [[silica]]. Because the first SSFs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation, it is more likely that they represent early steps in an [[evolutionary arms race]] between predators and increasingly well-defended prey. On the other hand mineralized [[skeleton]]s may have evolved simply because they are stronger and cheaper to produce than all-organic skeletons like those of insects. Nevertheless it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible.

Although the small size and often fragmentary nature of SSFs makes it difficult to identify and classify them, they provide very important evidence for how the main groups of marine [[invertebrate]]s evolved, and particularly for the pace and pattern of evolution in the [[Cambrian explosion]]. Besides including the earliest known representatives of some modern [[phylum|phyla]], they have the great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of Early Cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts.

==History of discovery==
{{Small shelly fauna graphical timeline}}
The term &quot;small shelly fossils&quot; was coined by Samuel Matthews and V.V. Missarzhevsky in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matthews, S.C., and Missarzhevsky, V.V.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite a [[misnomer]] since, as Stefan Bengtson says, &quot;they are not always small, they are commonly not shelly – and the term might equally well apply to [[Pleistocene]] [[Periwinkle (mollusc)|periwinkle]]s.&quot; Paleontologists have been unable to invent a better term and have vented their frustration in parodies such as &quot;small silly fossils&quot; and &quot;small smellies&quot;. The term is often abbreviated to &quot;small shellies&quot; or &quot;SSF&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt;

The great majority of all the morphological features of later shelled organisms appear among the SSFs.&lt;ref name=Dzik1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt; No-one has attempted a formal definition of &quot;small shelly fauna&quot;, &quot;small shelly fossils&quot; or other similar phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

Specimens and sometimes quite rich collections of these fossils were discovered between 1872 and 1967, but no-one drew the conclusion that the Early Cambrian contained a diverse range of animals in addition to the traditionally recognized [[trilobite]]s, [[archaeocyatha]]ns, etc. In the late 1960s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] paleontologists discovered even richer collections of SSFs in beds below and therefore earlier than those containing Cambrian trilobites. Unfortunately the papers that described these discoveries were in [[Russian language|Russian]], and the 1975 paper by Matthews and Missarzhevsky first brought the SSFs to the serious attention of the non-Russian-reading world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt;

There was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of [[animal]]s.  [[Preston Cloud]] argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was &quot;explosive&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{

Rich collections have been found in [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Australia]], and [[Antarctica]]; and moderately [[Biodiversity|diverse]] ones in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt;

There are different views about the time range of the SSFs. The Russian discoveries of the late 1960s were assigned to the [[Tommotian]] [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Cambrian]] [[period (geology)|period]], and for some time the term &quot;small shelly fauna&quot; was applied only to that age. On the other hand Bengston includes in &quot;SSF&quot; [[Ediacaran]] fossils like ''[[Cloudina]]'' and post-Tommotian fossils like ''[[Microdictyon]]'' from the  [[Maotianshan shales]] [[lagerstätte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt; SSFs have been found in layers that also contain fossil [[trilobite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

==Mode of preservation==
Small shelly fossils are typically, although not always, preserved in [[phosphate]], which may or may not have been their original mineral composition. They are usually extracted from limestone by placing the limestone in a weak acid, typically [[acetic acid]]; the phosphatized fossils remain after the rock is dissolved away.&lt;ref name=Dzik2007/&gt; Preservation by a covering of phosphate only seems to have been common during the early Cambrian, becoming rarer with time as a result of increased [[bioturbation|disturbance of sea-floors by burrowing animals]]. If not protected in this way, small shelly fossils would have dissolved in the acids used to extract them. Hence perhaps the animals that produced these fossils lived earlier and later than the period in which they are commonly found, but were simply not successfully extracted from rocks – the apparent extinction of most SSFs by the end of the [[Cambrian]] may be an illusion.&lt;ref name=Dzik2007&gt;{{The Rise and Fall of the Ediacaran Biota|Dzik, J|The Verdun Syndrome: simultaneous origin of protective armour and infaunal shelters at the Precambrian–Cambrian transition|405|414|30|http://www.paleo.pan.pl/people/Dzik/Publications/Verdun.pdf | accessdate=2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2004ClosingPhosphatizationWindow&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal

A recently-discovered modern [[gastropod]] that lives near deep-sea [[hydrothermal vent]]s illustrates the influence of both earlier and contemporary local chemical environments: its shell is made of [[aragonite]], which  is found in the earliest fossil [[mollusc]]s; but it also has armor plates on the sides of its foot, and these are mineralized with the iron sulfides [[pyrite]] and [[greigite]], which had never previously been found in any [[metazoan]] but whose ingredients are emitted in large quantities by the vents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt;

Methods of constructing shells vary widely among the SSF, and in most cases the exact mechanisms are not known.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt;

[[Biomineralization]] is the production of mineralized parts by organisms. Hypotheses to explain the evolution of biomineralization include physiological adaptation to changing chemistry of the oceans, defense against predators and the opportunity to grow larger. The functions of biomineralization in SSFs vary: some SSFs are not yet understood; some are components of armor; and some are [[skeleton]]s. A skeleton is any fairly rigid structure of an animal, irrespective of whether it has joints and irrespective of whether it is [[biomineralization|biomineralized]]. Although some SSFs may not be skeletons, SSFs are [[biomineralization|biomineralized]] by definition, being shelly. Skeletons provide a wide range of possible advantages, including : protection, support, attachment to a surface, a platform or set of levers for muscles to act on, [[traction]] when moving on a surface, food handling, provision of [[filtration]] chambers and storage of essential substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt; 

It has often been suggested that biomineralization evolved as a response to an increase in the concentration of [[calcium]] in the seas, which happened around the [[Ediacaran]]-[[Cambrian]] boundary, and that biomineralization's main benefit was to store harmlessly minerals that might have disrupted organisms' internal processes. For example [[Mikhail A. Fedonkin]] suggested that an increase in the length of [[food chain]]s may have contributed, as animals higher up the food chain accumulate greater amounts of waste products and toxins relative to their size, and biomineralization may have been a way of isolating excess carbonates or silicates consumed with prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fedonkin2003OriginOfMetazoa&quot; /&gt; However, biomineralizing a skeleton is a fairly expensive way to dispose safely of excess minerals, as the main construction cost is the organic matrix, mostly [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, with which minerals are combined to form [[composite material]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt; The idea that biomineralization was a response to changes in ocean chemistry is also undermined by the fact that small shelly fossils made of [[calcite]], [[aragonite]], [[calcium phosphate]] and [[silica]] appeared virtually simultaneously in a range of environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dzik2007&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Cloudina bud n boring 01.png| thumb |right| 100px | ''[[Cloudina]]'' specimen showing predatory boring (arrow). ]] 
Organisms started burrowing to avoid [[predation]] at around the same time. Jerzy Dzik suggested that biomineralization of skeletons was a defense against predators, marking the start of an [[evolutionary arms race]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dzik2007&quot; /&gt; He cited as an other example of hardened defenses from this time the fact that the earliest protective &quot;skeletons&quot; included glued-together collections  of inorganic objects — for example the Early Cambrian worm ''Onuphionella'' built a tube covered with [[mica]] flakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal 
| author=Signor, P.W., and McMenamin, M.A.S. | year=1988 
| title=The Early Cambrian worm tube ''Onuphionella'' from California and Nevada | journal =Journal of Paleontology | volume=62 | pages=233–240 
| url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1305228 | accessdate=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a strategy required both anatomical adaptations that allowed organisms to collect and glue objects and also moderately sophisticated nervous systems to co-ordinate this behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dzik2007&quot; /&gt;

On the other hand Bernard Cohen argued that biomineralized skeletons arose for &quot;engineering&quot; reasons rather than as defenses. There are many other defensive strategies available to prey animals including mobility and acute senses, chemical defenses, and concealment. Mineral-organic composites are both stronger and cheaper to build than all-organic skeletons, and these two advantages would have made it possible for animals to grow larger and, in some cases, more muscular — in animals beyond a certain size, the larger muscles and their greater [[leverage]] produce forces which all-organic skeletons are not rigid enough to withstand. The development of modern [[brachiopod]]s includes a progression from all-organic to mineral-organic composite shells, which may be a [[Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny|clue to their evolutionary development]]. The evolution of rigid biomineralized exoskeletons may then have started an arms race in which predators developed drills or chemical weapons capable of penetrating shells, some prey animals developed heavier, tougher shells, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedonkin suggested another explanation for the appearance of biomineralization around the start of the Cambrian: the [[Ediacara biota]] evolved and flourished in cold waters, which slowed their metabolisms and left them with insufficient spare energy for biomineralization; but there are signs of global warming around the start of the Cambrian, which would have made biomineralization easier. A similar pattern is visible in living marine animals, since biomineralized skeletons are rarer and more fragile in polar waters than in the tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fedonkin2003OriginOfMetazoa&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very similar shelly fossil ''[[Sinotubulites]]'', which is often found in the same locations, was not affected by borings. In addition, the distribution of borings in ''Cloudina'' suggests selection for size – the largest holes appear in the largest shells. This evidence of ''selective'' attacks by predators suggests that new species may have arisen in response to predation, which is often presented as a potential cause of the rapid diversification of animals in the Early Cambrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson1992PredatorialBorings&quot; /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the SSFs are difficult to identify, those which have been assigned positions in modern [[taxon|taxa]], or in their [[stem group]]s of evolutionary &quot;aunts&quot; or &quot;cousins&quot;, enable scientists to assess the pattern and speed of animal evolution on the strength of the small shelly evidence.
Such an assessment shows that the earliest small shellies are the most basal.  As time goes on, they can be placed in the stem group to an ever smaller clade.  In other words, the earliest (Ediacaran) small shellies can be tentatively considered [[diploblastic]], in other words made of two main tissue layers.  Later shellies are more convincingly diploblastic. Subsequently the [[Helcionellid]]s are the first shelly fossils that can be placed in the stem group to a phylum ([[mollusca]]). As one looks at more recent SSFs, the arguments for stem group placements become stronger, and by the [[Atdabanian]], some SSFs can be assigned to the crown group of a modern phylum, [[echinoderm]]s.&lt;ref name=Budd2003/&gt;

In finds from the early Cambrian, tubes and spicules become more abundant and diverse, and new types of SSF appear.

Some sclerites are mineralized with [[calcium phosphate]] rather than [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot; /&gt; Tommotiids have a wide range of sclerite shapes and internal structures, and may in fact represent a [[polyphyletic]] set of lineages, in other words they may have independently developed phosphatic scleritomes rather than inheriting them from a common ancestor.

{{for|the Japanese lexical law|Ōno's lexical law}}

'''Ohno's law''' was proposed by a Japanese biologist [[Susumu Ohno]], saying that the [[gene]] content of the [[mammal]]ian [[species]] has been conserved over species not only in the [[DNA]] content but also in the genes themselves. That is, nearly all mammalian species have conserved the [[X chromosome]] from their primodial X chromosome of a common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Ohno67&gt;Ohno S (1967). ''Sex Chromosomes and sex-linked genes.'' Berlin:Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
As a [[Cell biology|cytological]] evidence, in first, mammalian X chromosomes in various species, including [[human]] and [[mouse]], have nearly the same size, with the content of about 5% of the genome. Second, for individual [[Locus (genetics)|gene loci]], a number of X-linked genes are common through mammalian species.  Examples are found in [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD), a gene for polypeptide of [[antihemophilic globulin]] (AHG or [[Factor VIII]]) in [[Haemophilia A|hemophilia A]] and [[Haemophilia B|B]], and plasma thromboplastin component gene (PTC or [[Factor IX]]). Moreover, no instances were found where an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] gene in one species was located on an [[autosome]] in the other species.&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;

== Conservation mechanisms ==
The content of a chromosome would be changed mainly by mutation after duplication of the chromosome and translocation with other chromosomes. However, in mammals, since the chromosomal [[Sex-determination system|sex-determination]] mechanism would have been established in their earlier stages of [[evolution]], [[polyploidy]] would have not occurred due to its incompatibility with the sex-determining mechanism. Moreover, X-autosome [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] would have been prohibited because it might have resulted in detrimental effects for survival to the organism. Thus in mammals, the content of X chromosomes has been conserved after typical 2 round duplication events at early ancestral stages of evolution, at the fish or amphibia ([[2R hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name=Ohno67 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ohno70&gt;Ohno S (1970). ''Evolution by Gene Duplication.'' London: Allen and Unwin, ISBN 0045750157.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contradicting and supportive evidence ==
Genes on the long arm of the human X are contained in the monotreme X and genes on the short arm of the human X are distributed on the autosomes of marsupials.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson JM, Riggs A, Graves JA (1992). &quot;Gene mapping studies confirm the homology between the platypus X and echidna X1 chromosomes and identify a conserved ancestral monotreme X chromosome&quot;. ''Chromosoma'' 101(10): 596–601, PMID 1424984.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno commented to the result that [[monotreme]]s and [[marsupial]]s were not considered to be ancestors of true mammals, but they have diverged very early from the main line of mammals.&lt;ref name=Ohno93&gt;Ohno S (1993). &quot;Patterns in genome evolution&quot;. ''Curr Opin Genet Dev'' 3(6): 911–914, PMID 8118217.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chloride channel]] gene (''CLCN4'') was mapped to the human X but on chromosome 7 of C57BL/6 mice, species of [[House Mouse|''Mus musculus'']], though the gene is located on X of [[Algerian Mouse|''Mus spretus'']] and [[rat]].&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;Palmer S, Perry J, Ashworth A (1995). &quot;A contravention of ohno's law in mice&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}
Since 1990 there has been intense debate among [[paleontologist]]s about the evolution in the Early [[Cambrian]] period of the &quot;super-[[phylum]]&quot; [[Lophotrochozoa]], which is thought to include the modern [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]] worms and [[brachiopod]]s, as well as their evolutionary &quot;aunts&quot; and &quot;cousins&quot;.

The name &quot;halwaxiid&quot; was formed by combining the names of two members of the proposed group, ''[[Halkieria]]'' and ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. The group was defined as a set of Early to Mid [[Cambrian]] animals that had: a &quot;chain mail&quot; coat of three [[concentric]] bands of small armor plates that are called [[sclerite]]s; in some cases, a small cap-like shell at the front end and in some cases both ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt; Some scientists are unhappy with this loose definition, arguing that such traits may have arisen [[convergent evolution|convergently]] rather being inherited from a common ancestor. This objection suggests that the group is not [[monophyletic]],&lt;ref name=ButterfieldPalAss&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words that the group does not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor. In fact the originators of the term &quot;halwaxiid&quot; prefer an evolutionary &quot;family tree&quot; in which the halwaxiids are not monophyletic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;

Other fossil organisms became involved in the debate as there were plausible arguments for considering them closely related to the halkieriids or ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' or both. One was the more recently discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which looked an intermediate between the halkieriids and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as it had a shell like that of halkieriids, and [[Biomineralization|unmineralized]] sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – in fact the article which first described ''Orthrozanclus'' introduced the term &quot;halwaxiid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt; New finds of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'' put this animal into play as well since, despite its lack of sclerites or shells, its feeding apparatus looks very like ''Wiwaxia''’s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2006&quot; /&gt; The [[Siphogonotuchida|siphogonotuchids]], a very Early Cambrian group known only from isolated sclerites among the [[small shelly fossils]], also appear in analyses as their sclerites suggest this group  may have been close to the ancestors of halkieriids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Genera group=note&gt;The original, possibly incomplete, list includes ''[[Australohalkieria]], [[Drepanochites]], [[Eohalobia]], [[Halkieria]], [[Lomasulcachites]], [[Ninella]], [[Ocruranus]], [[Oikozetetes]], [[Orthrozanclus]], [[Sinosachites]], [[Siphogonuchites]], [[Thambetolepis]]'', and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' — {{cite journal

==Suggested phylogenies==
Since 1995 several [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or evolutionary &quot;family trees&quot;, have been suggested for these organisms.

The most intense part of the debate centers round ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. Conway Morris (1985) originally dismissed the earliest classification of ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as a [[polychaete]] worm, because he thought there was little structural similarity between a polychaete's scale-like [[elytra]] and ''Wiwaxia''’s [[sclerite]]s, and because the arrangement of the sclerites, with quite different numbers in each band, showed no sign of the regular [[segmentation]] that is a feature of polychaetes. Instead he thought ''Wiwaxia'' was very similar to shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, that it must have moved on a mollusc-like muscular foot, and that its feeding apparatus looked like a primitive form of the molluscan [[radula]], a tooth-bearing [[chitin]]ous &quot;tongue&quot;. Hence he classified it as a &quot;[[cladistics|sister]]&quot; of the molluscs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorris1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Shortly after this in 1990 Butterfield published his first paper on ''Wiwaxia''. He argued that, since ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites appeared  to be solid, they were not similar to the hollow sclerites of halkieriids. In fact he thought they were more similar to to the chitinous bristles ([[setae]]) that project from the bodies of modern annelids and in some [[genus|genera]] form leaf-like scales that cover the back like roof tiles - in composition, in detailed structure, in how they were attached to the body via follicle-like pockets in the skin, and in overall appearance. He also contended that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus, instead of being mounted in the middle of its &quot;head&quot;, was just as likely to be mounted in two parts on the sides of the &quot;head&quot;, an arrangement that is common in polychaetes. He therefore classified ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway Morris and Peel (1995) largely accepted Butterfield's arguments and treated ''Wiwaxia'' as an ancestor or &quot;aunt&quot; of the polychaetes. However they maintained that Wiwaxia’s feeding aparatus was much more like a molluscan radula. They also argued that Wiwaxia was fairly closely related to and in fact descended from the halkieriids, as the sclerites are divided into similar groups, although those of halkieriids were much smaller, more numerous and hollow. They wrote that in 1994 Butterfield had found ''Wiwaxia'' sclerites that were clearly hollow. The cladogram they presented showed the halkieriids split into three groups: one as &quot;aunts&quot; of [[brachiopod]]s, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the [[lophophore]]; the second group of halkieriids as &quot;aunts&quot; of both ''Wiwaxia'' and [[annelid]] worms; and the earliest halkieriids as &quot;great aunts&quot; of all of these.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisPeel1995&quot; /&gt;

Marine biologist Amélie H. Scheltema  ''et al.'' (2003) argued that ''Wiwaxia''’s feeding apparatus is very similar to the [[radula]]s of some modern shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, and that the sclerites of the two groups are very similar. They concluded that ''Wiwaxia'' was a member of a [[clade]] that includes molluscs.&lt;ref name=&quot;www3.interscience.wiley.com&quot;/&gt;

Danish zoologist Danny Eibye-Jacobsen (2004) regarded bristles as a feature shared by molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. Hence even if ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites closely resembled bristles, which he doubted, this would not prove that ''Wiwaxia''’s closest relative were annelids. He also pointed out that the very different numbers of sclerites in the various zones of ''Wiwaxia''’s body do not correspond to any reasonable pattern of segmentation. Since in his opinion ''Wiwaxia'' lacked other clearly polychaete features, he regarded this as an argument against classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete. In his opinion there were no strong grounds for classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc.&lt;ref name=&quot;EibyeJacobsen2004&quot;/&gt;

Caron, Scheltema ''et al.'' (2006), in a paper about newly-discovered and good specimens of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'', thought ''Wiwaxia'' bore little resemblance to polychaetes as it showed no signs of the segmentation, [[appendage]]s in front of the mouth, or &quot;[[parapodia|legs]]&quot; – all of which are typical polychaete features. On the other hand they thought the teeth on the feeding apparatus of both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' strongly resembled those of a modern group of molluscs, [[Neomeniomorpha]]. Hence they classified ''Wiwaxia'' as an &quot;aunt&quot; and ''Odontogriphus'' as a &quot;great aunt&quot; of molluscs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaronScheltemaSchanderRudkin2006&quot; /&gt;

Butterfield returned to the debate in 2006, repeating the arguments he presented in 1990 for regarding ''Wiwaxia'' as an early polychaete and adding that, while bristles are a feature of several groups, they appear as a covering over the back only in polychaetes. He also questioned whether the two or three rows of teeth in ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' could function in the same way as the belt-like molluscan radula with its many tooth-rows; on the other hand one group of polychaetes uses a single two-part &quot;jaw&quot; to scrape food off a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. While he agreed that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were very similar, he wrote, &quot;… it certainly does not require that they be [[shoehorn]]ed into the same lineage. … the seemingly trivial distinction between these two taxa is exactly what is expected at the divergence points leading from a last common ancestor to extant phyla.&quot;&lt;ref name=Butterfield2006&gt;{{cite journal

Butterfield (2006) accepted that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were closely related, but argued that they were stem-group polychaetes rather than stem-group molluscs. In his opinion the feeding apparatus of these organisms, with consisted of two or at most four rows of teeth, could not perform perform the functions of the &quot;belt-like&quot; molluscan radula with their numerous tooh-rows; the different tooth-rows in both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' tooth-rows also have noticeably different shapes, while those of molluscan radulae are produced one after the other by the same group of &quot;factory&quot; cells and therefore are almost identical. He also regarded lines running across the middle region of ''Odontogriphus'' fossils as evidence of external segmentation, since the lines are evenly-spaced and run exactly at [[right angle]]s to the long axis of the body. As in his earlier papers, Butterfield emphasized the similarities of internal structure between ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites and the bristles of polychaetes, and the fact that polychates are the only modern organisms in which some of the bristles form a covering over the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007 Conway Morris and Caron described a new fossil, ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which had a [[Biomineralization|mineralized]] shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – and, like both of these, a soft underside which they interpreted as a muscular foot, and a similar arrangement of the sclerites into three [[concentric]] bands. Some of ''Orthrozanclus''’s sclerites appear to have been hollow, as the specimen includes what look like internal [[casting]]s. They took this find as evidence that the halkieriids, ''Wiwaxia'' and ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' were very closely related and formed the group &quot;halwaxiids&quot;. However the simplest &quot;family tree&quot; faces an obstacle: the siphogonuchitids appear in earlier rocks and had ''mineralized'' sclerites. Hence Conway Morris and Caron found it necessary to consider two more complex family trees, concluding that &quot;Hypothesis 1&quot; fitted the available data better, but fell apart if there were [[sensitivity analysis|minor changes]] in the characteristics used:&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;
#''Odontogriphus'', which had no sclerites or shells, was an &quot;aunt&quot; of the molluscs and the halwaxiids were a &quot;sister&quot; group to molluscs. ''Wiwaxia'', with only unmineralized armor, was a surviving member of the most primitive halwaxiids. The siphogonuchitids developed mineralized sclerites but grouped into a simpler &quot;chain mail&quot; arrangement. Halkieriids then regained the more complex three-band &quot;chain mail&quot; arrangement and also developed shells. ''Orthrozanclus'' lost one of the shells and its sclerites lost the mineralization. Because the siphogonuchitids appear in this family tree between ''Wiwaxia'' and the other halwaxiids, the halwaxiids are not [[monophyletic]] in this tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;
#In &quot;Hypothesis 2&quot; the halwaxiids are [[monophyletic]] and the siphogonuchitids are their nearest non-halwaxiid relatives. The halwaxiids plus siphogonuchitids form a &quot;sister&quot; group to both the annelids and brachiopods, and the molluscs are the &quot;aunts&quot; of all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;

Conway Morris and Caron (2007) published the first description of ''[[Orthrozanclus]] reburrus''. This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and ''one'' shell at what was presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to ''Halkieria''’s front shell. It also had long spines rather like those of ''Wiwaxia''. Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature as evidence that the &quot;halwaxiids&quot; were a valid [[taxon]] and were [[monophyletic]], in other words shared a common ancestor with each other and with no other organism. They published ''two'' cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the [[lophotrochozoa]], the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods:&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;
# This is the more likely, although it falls apart if the organisms' characteristics are changed even slightly:&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive molluscs, without sclerites or any kind of mineralized armor.
#*''Wiwaxia'', the siphogonotuchids, ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Halkeria'' from a side-branch of the mollusc family tree, which diverged in that order. This would mean that: ''Wiwaxia'' was the first of them to have sclerites, which were unmineralized; the siphogonotuchids were the first to have mineralized sclerites, although the scleritome was simpler; halkieriids then develop more complex scleritomes, while in ''Orthrozanclus'' the scleritome became unmineralized again and the rear shell vanished or became so  small that it has not been seen in fossils. This hypothesis faces the difficulty that siphogonotuchids appear in earlier rocks and have simpler scleritomes than the other three groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;
#*The annelids and brachiopods evolved from the other main branch of the family tree, which did not include the molluscs.
# The alternative view is:
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive lophotrochozoans.
#*The siphogonotuchids, ''Halkeria'', ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Wiwaxia'' form a group that is closer to the shared ancestor of annelids and brachiopods than it is to the molluscs. The siphogonotuchids are the first of the group to become distinctive, with ''two'' types of mineralized sclerites and a &quot;shell&quot; made of fused sclerites. Halkieriids had three types of sclerites  and two one-piece shells. In ''Orthrozanclus'' the sclerites became unmineralized and in ''Wiwaxia'' the shells were lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;

==Halkieriids and siphogonotuchids==
{{see|Halkieriid}}
Most of the debate has been about halkieriids' relationship to [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[brachiopod]]s. However a paper published in 2008 argued that halkieriids were closely related to [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s, which have been generally regarded as [[sponge]]s.

===Relationship to Molluscs, Annelids and Brachiopods===
Halkieriid [[sclerite]]s were known for a long time as elements of the [[small shelly fossils]]. The first articulated specimens, with all their hard parts together, were collected in 1989 and were described briefly in 1990 by Conway Morris and Peel (1990).&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisPeel1990&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal

In 2003 Cohen, Holmer and Luter supported the halkieriid-brachiopod relationship, suggesting that brachiopods may have arisen from a halkieriid lineage that developed a shorter body and larger shells, and then folded itself and finally grew a stalk out of what used to be the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

Vinther and Nielsen (2005) proposed instead that ''Halkieria'' was a [[crown group]] mollusc, in other words more similar to modern molluscs that to annelids, brachiopods or any intermediate groups. They argued that: ''Halkieria''’s sclerites resembled those of the modern [[solenogaster]] [[aplacophora]]n shell-less molluscs, of some modern [[polyplacophora]]n molluscs, which have several shell plates, and of the [[Ordovician]] polyplacophoran ''[[Echinochiton]]''; ''Halkieria''’s shells are more similar to the shells of [[conchifera]]n molluscs, since shells of both of these groups show no trace of the canals and pores seen in polyplacophoran shell plates; the bristles of brachiopods and annelids are similar to each other but not to ''Halkieria''’s sclerites.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

However Conway Morris (2006) criticized Vinther and Nielsen's classification of ''Halkieria'' as a crown group mollusc, on the grounds that the growth of the spicules in the aplacophorans and polyplacophorans is not similar to the method of growth deduced for the complex halkieriid sclerites; in particular, he said, the hollow spines of various molluscs are not at all like the halkieriid sclerites with their complex internal channels. Conway Morris repeated his earlier conclusion that halkieriids were close to the ancestors of both molluscs and brachiopods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In their description of the newly-discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' (2007), which has similarities to both ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids, Conway Morris and Caron also took account of the siphogonuchitids, a group known only from isolated mineralized sclerites that resemble those of the halkieriids. They proposed the two &quot;family trees&quot; described above:
# The halkieriids formed part of a &quot;sister&quot; group to the molluscs.  This hypothesis implies that the halwaxiids were not [[monophyletic]], since the siphogonuchitids appear between ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids. Nevertheless Conway Morris and Caron found that this [[phylogeny]] fitted the available data better, although it was not robust.
# The siphogonuchitids plus the halwaxiids formed a &quot;sister&quot; group to the annelids and brachopods, while the molluscs were &quot;aunts&quot; of all of these.&lt;ref name=&quot;ConwayMorrisCaron2007&quot; /&gt;

===Relationship to chancelloriids===
[[Image:Chancelloriid scleritomes 01.png| thumb | right | 250px | [[Chancelloriidae|Chancelloriid]] [[sclerite|scleritomes]] ]]
Porter (2008) revived an early 1980s idea that the sclerites of ''Halkieria'' are extremely similar to those of [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s. These were sessile, bag-like, [[Radial_symmetry#Radial_symmetry|radially-symmetric]] organisms with an opening at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids&quot; /&gt; 

Since their fossils show no signs of a gut or other organs, chancelloriids were originally classified as some kind of [[sponge]]. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of [[spongin]], a [[collagen]] [[protein]], in  modern keratose (horny) [[demosponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

| journal=Journal of Paleontology | volume=70 | pages=893–899
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view on several grounds, including that: the [[silica]]-based spines of demosponges are solid, while chancellorid sclerites hollow, probalby made of [[aragonite]], and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal at the bases of the sclerites; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called [[pinacoderm]]s, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and show signs of connective structures called belt [[desmosome]]s. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the [[Epitheliazoa]], the next higher [[taxon]] above the [[Porifera]], to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the [[Eumetazoa]], &quot;true animals&quot; whose tissues are organized into [[Germ layer]]s: chancellorids' lack of internal organs would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[filter feeder|filter-feeders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JanussenSteinerZhu2002&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal

The sclerites of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have an internal &quot;pulp cavity&quot; and a thin external organic layer; the walls are made of the same material, [[aragonite]]; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers is in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. It is extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma may be resolved in various ways:&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal

* One possibility is that chancelloriids evolved from [[bilaterian]] ancestors but then adopted a sessile lifestyle and rapidly lost all unnecessary features. However the gut and other internal organs have not been lost in other bilaterians that lost their external bilateral symmetry, such as [[echinoderm]]s, [[priapulid]]s, and [[kinorhynch]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids&quot; /&gt;
* On the other hand perhaps chancelloriids are similar to the organisms from which bilaterians evolved. That would imply that the earliest bilaterians had similar sclerites. However there are no fossils of such sclerites before {{ma|542}}, while ''[[Kimberella]]'' from {{ma|555}} was almost certainly a bilaterian,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fedonkin1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

* One solution to this [[dilemma]] may be that preservation of [[small shelly fossils]] by coatings of [[phosphate]] was common only  for a relatively short time, during the Early Cambrian, and that coelosclerite-bearing organisms were alive several million years before and after the time of phosphatic preservation.

* Alternatively, perhaps the common ancestor of both chancelloriids and halkieriids had very similar but unmineralized coelosclerites, and some intermediate groups independently incorporated aragonite into these very similar structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Evolution3}}
The '''evolutionary history of [[life on Earth]]''' traces the processes by which living and [[fossil]] organisms [[evolution|evolved]]. It stretches back over {{ma|3000|}}, possibly as far as {{ma|3800}}, and there is evidence that [[evolution]] continues, even in humans. All present-day [[organism]]s use the same large set of complex [[chemical reaction]]s, which indicates that all modern organisms share a [[Last universal common ancestor|common ancestor]]. However even the simplest modern organisms are too complex to have emerged directly from non-living materials. Some scientists have proposed that life on Earth was [[panspermia|&quot;seeded&quot; from elsewhere]], but most research concentrates on how simpler forms of life could have [[Abiogenesis|arisen independently]] on Earth.

For about 2,000 million years multi-layered [[microbial mat]]s were the dominant life. The evolution of [[Oxygen#Photosynthesis_and_respiration|oxygenic photosynthesis]] led to the [[Oxygen Catastrophe|oxygenation of the atmosphere]], beginning about {{ma|2400}}. While [[eukaryotic]] cells may have been present earlier, their evolution accelerated when they began to use oxygen in their [[metabolism]]. The earliest evidence of complex eukaryotes with [[organelle]]s, dates from {{ma|1850}}. Later, around {{ma|1700}}, eukaryotes evolved into [[multicellular]] organisms. The earliest known [[fossil]] [[animal]]s are [[cnidaria]]ns from about {{ma|580}}, although the earliest animals must have appeared before then. The earliest modern-looking [[bilateria]]n animals appear in the Early [[Cambrian]], along with several &quot;weird wonders&quot;. [[Vertebrates]] remained an obscure group until the first fish with jaws appeared in the Late [[Ordovician]].

The earliest land plants and [[invertebrate]]s date back to about {{ma|476}} and {{ma|490}} respectively. The lineage that produced land vertebrates evolved rapidly between {{ma|370}} and {{ma|360}}, acquiring limbs while still wholly aquatic. Land plants were so successful that they caused an [[ecological crisis]] in the Late [[Devonian]]. During the [[Permian]] period [[synapsid]]s, including the ancestors of [[mammal]]s, may have dominated the land, but the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] {{ma|251}} came close to wiping out complex life. During the recovery from this catastrophe, [[archosaur]]s became the most abundant land vertebrates. One archosaur group, the [[dinosaur]]s, dominated the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods, and [[bird]]s evolved from dinosaurs. During this time mammals' ancestors survived only as small  [[insectivore]]s. After the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] {{ma|65}} killed off the non-avian dinosaurs, mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity. Such [[mass extinction]]s may have accelerated evolution by providing opportunities for new groups of organisms to diversify. 

Fossil evidence indicates that [[flowering plant]]s appeared and rapidly diversified in the  Early [[Cretaceous]], between {{ma|130}} and {{ma|90}}, probably helped by [[coevolution]] with [[pollenation|pollinating]] insects. Flowering plants and marine [[phytoplankton]] are still the dominant [[Primary production|producers of organic matter]]. [[Social insects]] appeared around the same time as flowering plants. Although they occupy only small parts of the insect &quot;family tree&quot;, they now form over half the total mass of insects. Humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking [[ape]]s whose earliest fossils date from over {{ma|6}}. Although early members of this lineage had [[chimp]]-sized [[brain]]s, there are signs of a steady increase in brain size after about {{ma|3}}.

===Independent emergence on Earth===
{{main|Abiogenesis}}
Life on earth is based on [[carbon]] and [[water]]. Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment, especially from [[carbon dioxide]]. The only other element with similar chemical properties, [[silicon]], forms much less stable structures and, because most of its compounds are solids, would be more difficult for organisms to extract. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] and has two other useful properties: the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter; and its molecules have [[electric charge|electrically negative]] and positive ends, which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can. Other good solvents, such as [[ammonia]], are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life, and lack water's other advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of [[protein]]s from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock.

In modern underwater mats the top layer often consists of [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[cyanobacteria]] which create an [[oxygen]]-rich environment, while the bottom layer is oxygen-free and often dominated by [[hydrogen sulfide]] emitted by the organisms living there.&lt;ref name=&quot;RisattiEtAl1994MatCommunityStructure&quot; /&gt; It is estimated that the appearance of [[Oxygen#Photosynthesis_and_respiration|oxygenic photosynthesis]]   by bacteria in mats increased biological productivity by a factor of between 100 and 1,000.

[[Eucaryote]]s may have been present long before the [[Oxygen#Build-up_in_the_atmosphere|oxygenation of the atmosphere]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA&quot; /&gt; but most modern eucaryotes require oxygen, which their [[mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution&quot; /&gt; In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eucaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of [[endosymbiosis|endosymbioses]] between &quot;[[procaryote]]s&quot;. For example: a predatory micro-organism invaded a large procaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the [[mitochondria]]; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[cyanobacterium]], but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their [[genome]]s, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The initial advantages of multicellularity  may have included: increased resistance to predators, many of which attacked by engulfing; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface; the ability to reach upwards to filter-feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha&quot; /&gt; the ability to create an internal environment that gives protection against the external one;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonner1999OriginsOfMulticellularity&quot; /&gt; and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave &quot;intelligently&quot; by sharing information.&lt;ref name=&quot;NakagakiYamadaTóth2000Intelligence&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify, by creating more varied environments than flat [[microbial mat]]s could.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha&quot; /&gt;

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha&quot; /&gt;

The available evidence indicates that eucaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around {{ma|1000}}. The only respect in which eucaryotes clearly surpass [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eucaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha&quot; /&gt;

===Evolution of sex===
{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The defining characteristic of [[sexual reproduction]] is [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], in which each of the offspring receives 50% of its genetic inheritance from each of the parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokela2001SexAdvantage&quot; /&gt; [[Bacteria]] also exchange [[DNA]] by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]] and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baron2&quot;&gt;{{citation

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokela2001SexAdvantage&quot;&gt;{{citation

The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokela2001SexAdvantage&quot; /&gt;

The Mutation Deterministic Hypothesis assumes that each organism has more than one harmful [[mutation]] and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm done that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However the evidence suggests that the MDH's assumptions are shaky, because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokela2001SexAdvantage&quot; /&gt;

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and [[natural selection]] may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offest the disadvantages of  sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;OttoGerstein2006WhySex&quot; /&gt; Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jokela2001SexAdvantage&quot; /&gt;

The [[small shelly fauna]] are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and Mid Cambrian periods. The earliest, ''[[Cloudina]]'', shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an [[evolutionary arms race]]. Some tiny Early Cambrian shells almost certainly belonged to molluscs, while the owners of some &quot;armor plates&quot;, ''[[Halkieria]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]'',  were eventually identified when more complete specimens were found in Cambrian [[lagerstätte]]n that preserved soft-bodied animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bengtson2004&quot;&gt;{{citation | contribution=Early skeletal fossils

==Colonization of land==
Adaptation to life on land is a major challenge: all land organisms need to avoid drying-out and all those above microscopic size have to resist gravity; [[respiration]] and [[gas exchange]] systems have to change; reproductive systems cannot depend on water to carry eggs and sperm towards each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Evolution of soil===
Before the colonization of land, [[soil]], a combination of mineral particles and decomposed [[organic]] matter, did not exist. Land surfaces would have been either bare rock or unstable sand produced by [[weathering]]. Water and any nutrients in it would have drained away very quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear2000EarlyTerrestrialEcosystems&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Lichen.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Lichen]]s growing on [[concrete]] ]]
Films of [[cyanobacteria]], which are not plants but use the same [[photosynthesis]] mechanisms, have been found in modern deserts, and only in areas that are unsuitable for [[vascular plant]]s. This suggests that [[microbial mat]]s may have been the first organisms  to colonize dry land, possibly in the [[Precambrian]]. Mat-forming cyanobacteria could have gradually evolved resistance to dessication as they spread from the seas to [[tidal zone]]s and then to land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shear2000EarlyTerrestrialEcosystems&quot;&gt;{{citation

In aquatic algae, almost all cells are capable of photosynthesies and are nearly independent. Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized: photosynthesis was most efficient at the top; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants&quot; /&gt;

Animals had to change their feeding and [[excretory]] systems, and most land animals developed [[internal fertilization]] of their eggs.

&lt;/div&gt;Family tree of [[tetrapod]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from the most closely-related fish in a relatively short timespan in the Late [[Devonian]], from {{ma|370|}} to {{ma|360}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However in 1987 nearly-complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had legs and both lungs and gills, but could never have survived on land: its limbs  and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water&lt;!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush --&gt;. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clack2005GettingLegUp&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air-breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clack2005GettingLegUp&quot; /&gt;

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately there is then a gap of about 30 million years between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Mid [[Carboniferous]] fossils of vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land. Some of these look like early relatives of modern [[amphibian]]s, most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water, while others are accepted as early relatives of the [[amniote]]s, whose water-proof skins and eggs enable them to live and breed far from water.&lt;ref name=&quot;AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Social insects==
{{main|Social insects}}
The [[social insect]]s are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as [[natural selection]] and the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]. In fact there are very few [[eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among [[arthropod]]s, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Termite cathedral mounds in a bushfire blackened tropical savanna.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | These [[termite]] mounds have survived a bush fire. ]]
The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[haplodiploid]] method of [[sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Edward O. Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler|Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build &quot;fortresses&quot;; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages though co-operative foraging. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Bathyergidae|bathyergid]] mole rats,&lt;ref name=&quot;WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences&quot; /&gt; which are not haplodiploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossils|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late [[Carboniferous]], about {{ma|300}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern [[ecological niche]]s as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and [[insectivore]]s. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early [[Cretaceous]], and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Mid [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Mass extinctions==
{{main|Mass extinction}}
{{annotated image/Extinction|caption=Apparent extinction intensity, i.e. the fraction of [[genus|genera]] going extinct at any given time, as reconstructed from the [[fossil record]].  (Graph not meant to include recent epoch of [[Holocene extinction event]])}}
Life on earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542}}. Although they are disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of [[life on earth]]. When dominance of particular [[ecological niche]]s passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is &quot;superior&quot; to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first =M.

The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing. Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways:&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod2001Extinction&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&amp;nbsp;million years and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: [[dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Martin, R.

*Reasonably complete [[fossil]]s are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different [[genus|genera]] which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds – the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often unlike parts of any living organism. Many of the &quot;superfluous&quot; genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the &quot;superfluous&quot; genera appear to become extinct very quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod2001Extinction&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Spencer1.jpg|195px|thumb|right|[[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase, &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot;]]
'''''&quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;''''' is a [[phrase]] which is shorthand for a concept relating to competition for survival or predominance.  Originally applied by [[Herbert Spencer]] in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, Spencer drew parallels to his ideas of [[economics]] with [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by what Darwin termed [[natural selection]].

Darwin first used Spencer's phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as a synonym for &quot;natural selection&quot; in the fifth edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', published in 1869.&lt;ref name=1stD&gt;{{Citation

Survival is only one component of selection, and for example where a number of males survive to reproductive age, but only a few ever mate, the difference in reproductive success stems mainly from ability to attract mates rather than ability to survive. In an evolutionary sense, fitness is the average reproductive output of a class of genetic variants in a gene pool, and should not be confused with physically fit meaning biggest, fastest or strongest, which does not necessarily lead to reproductive success.&lt;ref name=IntroEvolutionaryBiology&gt;{{Citation

An interpretation of the phrase to mean &quot;only the fittest organisms will prevail&quot; (a view sometimes derided as &quot;[[social Darwinism]]&quot;) is not consistent with the actual theory of evolution. Any individual organism which succeeds in reproducing itself is &quot;fit&quot; and will contribute to survival of its species, not just the &quot;fittest&quot; ones, though some of the population will be better adapted to the circumstances than others. A more accurate characterization of evolution would be &quot;survival of the fit enough.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=03b_a0monNYC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22survival+of+the+fit+enough%22&amp;sig=3MzPHIVm2LR7jIB-AahJeAjsqyo Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction]''. Eugenie Carol Scott, University of California Press, 2005, ISBN 0520233913&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is sometimes misunderstood to simply mean &quot;survival of those who are better equipped for surviving,&quot; which is a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|rhetorical tautology]]. What Darwin meant was &quot;better adapted for immediate, local environment&quot;, tracking changing environments by differential preservation of organisms better adapted to live in them. The theory is not tautological as it contains an independent criterion of fitness.&lt;ref name=sjg&gt;&quot;Stephen Jay Gould, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gould_tautology.html Darwin's Untimely Burial]&quot;, 1976; from Michael Ruse, ed., Philosophy of Biology, New York: Prometheus Books, 1998, pp. 93-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the phrase ==
While the British economist [[Herbert Spencer]] is often credited with introducing the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;  in his 1851 work ''[[Social Statics]]'' (relating to [[free market]] [[economics]]) or his ''[[First Principles|First Principles of a New system of Philosophy]]'' of 1862, he actually did not use the phrase until after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]'', and introduced it in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, writing “This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.&quot;&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{Citation |url=http://educ.southern.edu/tour/who/pioneers/spencer.html |title=Herbert Spencer |publisher=Southern Adventist University  |accessdate=2007-08-29 |format= |work=}}&lt;br /&gt;
^ &quot;Herbert Spencer in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864, vol. 1, p. 444, wrote “This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called ‘natural selection’, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.” &quot;, {{Citation |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke |title=Better Competition Advocacy |accessdate=2007-08-29 |author=Maurice E.

of the Pac. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Man Versus The State'' Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation for why his theories would not be adopted by &quot;societies of militant type.&quot; He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.&lt;ref&gt;The principle of natural selection applied to groups of individual is known as [[Group selection]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

However, Spencer's ''Principles of Biology'' drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological ones and made first use in print of the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Darwin agreed with [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] that this phrase avoided the troublesome anthropomorphism of &quot;selecting&quot;, though it &quot;lost the analogy between nature's selection and the fanciers'.&quot; It was first used by Darwin in the 5th edition of ''The Origin'' published in 1869,&lt;ref name=1stD/&gt; in which Chapter 4 describes what he calls &quot;Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest.&quot;&lt;ref name=OriginCh4/&gt; In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing &quot;I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.

In modern times, however, the phrase is widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained [[competition]], and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of [[Social Darwinism]]. Its shortcomings as a description of Darwinian evolution have also become more apparent (see below).

Evolutionary [[biologist]]s criticize how the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in [[pop culture|popular culture]].  The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection and modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term [[natural selection]].  Indeed, in modern biology, the term [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] measures [[reproductive success]] and is not explicit about the specific ways in which organisms can be &quot;fit&quot; as in &quot;having [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics which enhance survival and reproduction&quot; (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).

== Is &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; a tautology? ==
{{Citations missing|date=December 2008}}
{{Original research|date=December 2008}}
&quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; is sometimes claimed to be a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].  The reasoning is that if one takes the term &quot;fit&quot; to mean &quot;endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction&quot; (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; can simply be rewritten as &quot;survival of those who are better equipped for surviving&quot;. While this is not ''exactly'' a tautology (we might imagine a benevolent deity or experimenter that would consistently favour the poorly adapted, and destroy well-adapted creatures, so that  &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; might actually ''not'' occur), this is not a very informative statement: it simply reduces to a statement that the game of Life is not rigged in favour of the poorly adapted, which is not controversial. Furthermore, the expression ''does'' become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of &quot;fitness&quot; in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power. 

However, the expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of ''heritability''. It is true that the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. However, natural selection is ''not'' just survival of the fittest. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success, that is caused by ''[[heritable]]'' characters (see the article on [[natural selection]]). 

If certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of &quot;heritable&quot;) that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called &quot;[[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&quot; On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that &quot;survivors survive&quot; or &quot;reproducers reproduce&quot;; rather, it states that &quot;survivors survive, reproduce and ''therefore'' propagate any ''heritable'' characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success&quot;. This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the [[testable]] hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.) 

Skeptic Society founder and ''[[Skeptic (magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine publisher Dr. [[Michael Shermer]] addresses this argument in his 1997 book, ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are [[testable]] and [[falsifiable]] by virtue of their predictive power.  Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population.  Shermer hypothesizes that if [[hominid]] [[fossils]] were found in the same geological strata as [[trilobites]], it would be evidence against natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]]; ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]''; 1997; Pages 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;

== &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; and morality ==

Critics of [[evolution]] have argued that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; provides a justification for behaviour that undermines [[morality|moral standards]] by letting the strong set standards of justice to the detriment of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=23533 |title=WorldNetDaily: Survival of the fittest? |accessdate=2007-11-19 |author=Alan Keyes |authorlink=Alan Keyes |date=July 7, 2001 |publisher=[[WorldNetDaily]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, any use of evolutionary descriptions to set moral standards would be a [[naturalistic fallacy]] (or more specifically the [[is-ought problem]]), as prescriptive, moral statements cannot be derived from purely descriptive premises. Describing how things are does not imply that things ought to be that way. It is also simplistic to suggest that evolutionary &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; implies treating the weak badly, as social behaviour cooperating with others and treating them well improves evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref name=CA002&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CA/CA002.html |title=CA002: Survival of the fittest implies might makes right. |accessdate=2007-11-19 |author=Mark Isaak |date= 2004 |format= |work= |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EvolutionPhilosophy&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/evolphil/social.html |title=Evolution and Philosophy: Social Darwinism – Does evolution make might right? |accessdate=2007-11-21 |author=John S. Wilkins |date=1997 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot; theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century [[capitalism|capitalists]] as &quot;an ethical precept that sanctioned cutthroat economic competition&quot; and led to &quot;[[social Darwinism]]&quot; which allegedly glorified [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]], war and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=454 |title=Articles / Impact / Darwin's Influence on Ruthless Laissez Faire Capitalism - Institute for Creation Research |accessdate=2007-11-21 |author=Jerry Bergman|date= |publisher=[[Institute for Creation Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support, while commonly claiming justification from religion and [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horatio Alger]] mythology. The term &quot;social Darwinism&quot; referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' published in 1944.&lt;ref name=EvolutionPhilosophy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{Citation | last =Leonard | first =Thomas C. | title =Mistaking Eugenics for Social Darwinism: Why Eugenics is Missing from the History of American Economics | journal =History of Political Economy | volume = 37 | issue =supplement: | pages =200–233 | date = | year = 2005 | url =http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/mistaking.pdf | doi =10.1215/00182702-37-Suppl_1-200 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
When used as a criticism of Darwin's theory of evolution, this claim is also an example of the [[appeal to consequences]] fallacy – even if the concept of survival of the fittest was used as a justification for violence in human society, this has no effect on the truth of the theory of evolution by natural selection in the natural world.

== &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; and anarchism ==

Russian [[anarchist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] viewed the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Applying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self assertion, and concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle – has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible. A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth. This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on. Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niches available to mammals. The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the [[Cenozoic]], and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation.&lt;ref name=Jernvall1996&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.274.5292.1489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds find other ways to provide for each other, ie. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore, initiating an adaptive radiation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin and Evolution of Birds'' by Alan Feduccia (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes: Opportunity==
Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches, such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain. The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches.

In [[Lake Victoria]], an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley, over 300 species of [[cichlid]] fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years. 

Adaptive radiations commonly follow [[mass extinction]]s: following an extinction, many niches are left vacant. A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs with mammals at the [[K-T extinction event|end of the Cretaceous]], and of [[brachiopod]]s by bivalves at the [[P-T extinction|Permo-Triassic boundary]]..

A group of organisms is said to have common descent if they have a common [[ancestor]]. In modern [[biology]], it is generally accepted that all living [[organism]]s on [[Earth]] are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest life-like forms probably exchanged genetic material laterally in a manner that is analogous to [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer]] amongst bacteria. For this and other reasons, the most recent common ancestor may have been a genetic pool rather than an organism.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of '''universal common descent''' via an [[evolution]]ary process was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), and later in ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' (1871).
This theory is now generally accepted by biologists, and the [[last universal ancestor|last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA or LUA), that is, the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.9 billion years ago]]. The theory of a common ancestor between all organisms is one of the principles of evolution, although for [[single cell organism]]s and [[virus]]es, single [[phylogeny]] is disputed (see: [[origin of life]]).  
== History ==
{{seealso|History of evolutionary thought}}
In discussing the unity of God, [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], a [[Jewish]] [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]], discussed the similarities found in nature in his work ''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (&quot;Duties of the Heart&quot;), written in approximately [[1040]]:
:''&quot;The second [argument for God's unity] is drawn from the signs of wisdom which are manifest throughout this worlds, in its upper and lower regions, in its minerals, vegetation and animals.  When we study the world, it shows us that it is entirely the plan of a Designer, the work of a single Creator.  For we find that, with all the differences in its substances and elements, it shows uniformity in its effects and parts.  The signs of the Creator's wisdom, manifest in the smallest as well as in the largest creatures, testify that they all have one wise Creator.  If the world really had more than one Creator, diverse forms of wisdom would be manifest in its different parts and in its species and individuals.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chovot_ha-Levavot#Unity_of_God]]'', 7, as translated by [[Natan Slifkin]] in [[The Challenge of Creation]], (New York: Yashar Books, 2006) page 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor and diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]] was made in 1745 by the French mathematician and scientist [[Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] (1698-1759) in his work ''Vénus physique''. Specifically:
:''&quot;Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not live; others lacking reproductive organs could not perpetuate themselves... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced...&quot;''

In 1790, [[Immanuel Kant]] (Königsberg (Kaliningrad) 1724 - 1804), in his ''Kritik der Urtheilskraft'', states that the analogy of animal forms implies a common original type and thus a common parent.

Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], hypothesized in 1795 that all warm-blooded animals were descended from a single &quot;living filament&quot;:
:''&quot;...would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality...?&quot;'' (''Zoonomia'', 1795, section 39, &quot;Generation&quot;)

In 1859, Charles Darwin's ''The Origin of Species'' was published. The views about common descent expressed therein vary between suggesting that there was a single &quot;first creature&quot; to allowing that there may have been more than one. Here are the relevant quotations from the ''Conclusion'':

:''&quot;[P]robably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&quot;''

:''&quot;The whole history of the world, as at present known, ... will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants, was created.&quot;''

:''&quot;When I view all beings not as [[special creation]]s, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the [[Silurian]] system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.&quot;''

The famous closing sentence describes the &quot;grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one.&quot; The phrase &quot;one form&quot; here seems to hark back to the phrase &quot;some few beings&quot;; in any case, the choice of words is remarkable for its consistency with recent ideas about there having been a single ancestral &quot;genetic pool&quot;.

== Evidence of universal common descent ==
{{Main|Evidence of common descent}}
=== Common biochemistry and genetic code ===
All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into RNA, through the effect of protein- and RNA-enzymes, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy sources, etc. Furthermore, the [[genetic code]] (the &quot;translation table&quot; according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria to humans. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robin Knight et al. | year=2001 | title=Rewiring the keyboard: evolvability of the genetic code | journal=Nature Reviews - Genetics | pages=49–58 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pmid=11253070 | doi=10.1038/35047500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Selectively neutral similarities ====
Similarities which have no relevance to evolution and therefore cannot be explained by convergence, tend to be very compelling support for the universal common descent theory.

Such evidence has come from two domains: amino acid sequences and DNA sequences. [[Proteins]] with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical [[amino acid]] sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several codons (DNA triplets) that code for the same amino acid. Thus, if two species use the same [[codon]] at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for a recent common ancestor.

==== Other similarities ====
The universality of many aspects of cellular life is often pointed to as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and the fact that all [[amino acid]]s found in proteins are left-handed. It is possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in [[convergent evolution]].

=== Phylogenetic trees ===
{{PhylomapB|caption=A phylogenetic tree based on rRNA genes.}}
{{seealso|Tree of life (science)}}
Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed [[phylogenetic trees]] (that is, &quot;genealogic trees&quot; of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods (based on appearance, embryology, etc). Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data (based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences). Crucially, all these methods produce essentially similar results, despite the fact that most genetic variation has no influence over external morphology. The fact that phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying phylogeny - that is, common descent.&lt;ref&gt;Theobald, Douglas, [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence Consilience of independent phylogenies]. This is part of his [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/comdesc/ 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution] at the [[TalkOrigins Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illustrations of common descent ==
=== Artificial selection ===
[[Artificial selection]] offers remarkable examples of the amount of diversity that can exist between individuals sharing a late common ancestor. To perform artificial selection, one begins with a particular species (following examples include [[wolves]] and [[wild cabbage]]) and then, at every generation, only allow certain individuals to reproduce, based on the degree to which they exhibit certain desirable characteristics. In time, it is expected that these characteristics become increasingly well-developed in successive generations. Many examples of artificial selection, like the ones below, occurred without the guidance of modern scientific insight.
[[Image:IMG013biglittledogFX wb.jpg|thumb|This [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] show the wide range of dog breed sizes]]

===== Dog breeding =====
{{main|dog breeding}}
An obvious example of the power of artificial selection is the diversity found in various breed in domesticated [[dogs]]. The various breeds of dogs all share common ancestry (being all ultimately descended from [[wolves]]) but were domesticated by humans and then selectively bred in order to enhance various features such as coat color and length or body size. To see the wide range of difference between the many breeds of dogs compare the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], [[Great Dane]], [[Basset Hound]], [[Pug]], and [[Poodle]]. Also compare this enormous diversity with the relative uniformity of wild wolves.

===== Wild cabbage =====
[[Image:Brassica oleracea0.jpg|thumb|Wild Cabbage plant]]
{{main|Brassica oleracea}}
Early farmers cultivated many popular vegetables from the [[Brassica oleracea]] (common name ''wild cabbage'') by artificially selecting for certain attributes. Common vegetables such as [[cabbage]], [[kale]], [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]] and [[Brussels sprouts]] are all descendants of the wild cabbage plant.&lt;ref&gt;Biology of Plants (7th edition) by Raven, Evert, and Eichhorn, 2005, states that these vegetables were &quot;all produced from a single species of plant (Brassica oleraca), a member of the mustard family.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Brussels sprouts were created by artificially selecting for large [[bud]] size. Broccoli was bred by selecting for large [[flower]] stalks. Cabbage was created by selecting for short [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]. Kale was bred by selecting for large [[leaf|leaves]].

=== Natural selection ===
{{main|natural selection}}
[[Image:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|Darwin's finches]]
Natural selection is the evolutionary process by which heritable traits that increase an individual's fitness become more common, and heritable traits that decrease an individual's fitness become less common.

===== Darwin's finches =====
{{main|Darwin's finches}}
During Darwin's studies on the [[Galápagos Islands]], Darwin observed 13 species of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] that are closely related and differ most markedly in the shape of their beaks. The [[beak]] of each [[species]] is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by [[natural selection]]. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches is nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found [[insects]] to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the main land and it is thought that they [[Bird migration|migrated]] to the islands and began [[adaptation|adapting]] to their environment through [[natural selection]].

Ahistoricism is most frequently used as a criticism, referring to being historically inaccurate or ignorant (for example, an ''ahistorical'' attitude).  It can also describe a person's failure to frame an argument or issue in a historical context or to disregard historical fact or implication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pepper|first=David|title=Eco-socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|date=1993|pages=143-144|isbn=0415097193, 9780415097192}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <comment>/* Compared to other species */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pomeranian orange-sable Coco.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Toy dog]]s often display an extreme level of neoteny, resembling not just infant, but [[fetal]] wolves.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |title=The Covenant of the Wild: Why animals chose domestication |last=Budiansky |first=Stephen |year=1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300079931}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Neoteny''' ({{pron-en|niːˈɒtɨniː}}), also called '''juvenilization''', is the retention, by adults in a species, of traits previously seen only in juveniles (a kind of [[pedomorphosis]]), and is a subject studied in the field of [[developmental biology]]. In neoteny, the [[Physiology|physiological]] (or [[somatic]]) development of an animal or organism is slowed or delayed (alternatively, seen as a dilation of biological time). Ultimately this process results in the retention, in the adults of a [[species]], of juvenile physical characteristics well into maturity. The [[English language|English]] word ''neoteny'' is borrowed from the [[German language|German]] ''Neotenie'', the latter constructed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''νέος'' (young) and ''τείνειν'' (tend to). The standard [[adjectival]] form is &quot;neotenous&quot;,{{Fact|date=July 2008}} although &quot;neotenic&quot; is often used.

In [[invertebrate]] biology, neoteny is most easily identified when sexually mature, completely viable juveniles or larvae are found. 

Specific individual traits that differ in descendant organisms, when compared to ancestors, are sometimes called ''neotenies''; [[human]]s, for example, appear to have several neotenies in comparison to [[chimpanzee]]s.

==In evolution==

Neoteny plays a role in [[evolution]], as a means by which, over generations, a species can undergo a significant physical change. In such cases, a species’ neotenous form becomes its “normal” mature form, no longer dependent upon environmental triggers to inhibit maturity. The mechanism for this could be a [[mutation]] in or interactions between [[gene]]s involved in maturation, changing their function to impede this process.

Neoteny is not the only contributing factor affecting maturation in species that may have undergone neotenous changes over the course of their evolution, and its actual involvement in the following examples is not well understood: 
* flightless [[bird]]s&amp;mdash;physical proportions resemble those of the chicks of flighted birds;
* [[human]]s&amp;mdash;with traits such as sparse body hair and enlarged heads reminiscent of baby primates. [[Lactose tolerance]] in adults is a form of neoteny now considered normal in certain populations that traditionally consume cow's milk while most other humans are lactose intolerant as adults. It corresponds to a mutation that permits the digestion of lactose beyond the lactation period.
* pets, such as [[Dog#Neoteny in the rapid evolution of diverse dog breeds|dog]]s&amp;mdash;which share many physical features with the immature [[wolf]] (these same traits were found during the development of the [[tame silver fox]]).  Such puppy-like traits may have made early dogs seem &quot;cute&quot; and less threatening than wolves, leading to both natural and artificial selection of such dogs.

==In humans==
Neoteny in humans can be seen in different aspects. It can be compared with other [[great ape]] species, between the sexes and between individuals. Some examples include:
* the flatness of the human face compared to other [[primates]]
* late arrival of the teeth

===Compared to other species===
The idea that adult humans exhibit certain neotenous (juvenile) features, not evinced in the great apes, is about a century old. [[Louis Bolk]] made a long list of such traits,&lt;ref&gt;Bolk, L. 1926. ''Der Problem der Menschwerdung''. Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a short-list in ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.&lt;ref&gt;short-list of 25 characters reprinted in Gould, Stephen Jay 1977. ''Ontogeny and phylogeny''. Harvard. p357 &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Man, in his bodily development, is a primate foetus that has become sexually mature&quot; (Bolk). The human capacity for long continued learning may be construed as a juvenile trait greatly extended. However, there are, of course, significant differences between juvenile chimpanzees and adult humans, most obviously in human abstract rational thought and language and, less obviously, in the human female sexual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Young J.Z. 1957; 2nd ed 1975. ''The life of mammals''. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neoteny is just one aspect of the story of human evolution.

Another theory suggests that humans' neotenous characteristics were an evolutionary strategy that enabled [[Cro-Magnon]]s (''Homo sapiens'') to gain predominance over ''[[neanderthal|H. neanderthalensis]]'' (and possibly ''[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'') by appealing to these species' nurturing instincts through [[pedomorphosis|paedomorphic]] [[cuteness]] to avoid territorial aggression.  Noted anthropologist [[Björn Kurtén]] explores this concept in his paleofictional ''[[Dance of the Tiger]]'' (1980).

===Between sexes===
While neoteny is not necessarily a physical state experienced by humans, [[paedomorphic]] characteristics in women are widely [[Physical attractiveness#Determinants of female physical attractiveness|acknowledged as desirable by men]]. For instance, [[vellus hair]] is a juvenile characteristic. However, while men develop longer, coarser, thicker, and darker [[terminal hair]] through [[sexual differentiation]], women do not, leaving their vellus hair visible.

[[Desmond Morris]] discusses the importance of neoteny in human biology in ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' and ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]''.

===Between individuals===
Paedomorphic variations exist not only between the sexes, but also between [[ethnic group]]s{{Fact|date=March 2009}} and even between individuals.

Bruce Charlton suggests that there may be such a thing as &quot;psychological neoteny&quot;,  with cultural causes: &quot;In a psychological sense, some contemporary individuals never actually become adults.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See Charlton BG, [http://www.hedweb.com/bgcharlton/ed-boygenius.html The rise of the boy-genius: psychological neoteny, science and modern life]. ''Medical Hypotheses''. 2006; 67: 679–81. The article is also discussed by Matthew Hutson in [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20061201-000002.html The Peter Pan-demic], ''[[Psychology Today]]'' magazine, November/December 2006, and by Clay Risen in [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section3a.t-3.html?ex=1323406800&amp;en=3f6e0203d3bf81e6&amp;ei=5090 Psychological Neoteny], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', December 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed maturity might be a consequence of later parenthood, itself caused by more prolonged formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton BG, [http://www.hedweb.com/bgcharlton/psychological-neoteny.html Psychological neoteny and higher education: Associations with delayed parenthood] ''Medical Hypotheses''. 2007; 69: 237–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Juliet Schor]] suggests in ''Born to Buy'' that people raised in a modern consumer culture never attain an adult level of self-sufficiency.  These &quot;infantilized adults&quot; remain dependent on mass-produced products in the same way that a child is dependent upon parents.

==In other animals==
One example of a neotenic trait in [[vertebrate]]s is the [[salamander]] species [[axolotl]], which usually remains fully aquatic as it matures.  Other salamanders, such as the widespread [[tiger salamander]] of [[North America]], may retain the external [[gill]]s usually only present in immature individuals, as adults in some populations in marginal [[habitat]]s. The amphibian [[Rough-skinned Newt]] exhibits neoteny in numerous populations, with noted preference in certain geographic areas; moreover, the phenomenon of gill retention in this newt manifests gradations of neoteny in some populations, such that partial gill retention is seen in some individuals.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa)'', Globaltwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progenesis==
Neoteny and [[progenesis]] are both mechanisms that result in [[paedomorphosis]]. Neoteny delays physiological, but not sexual, maturity. Comparatively, [[progenesis]] speeds up sexual, but not physiological, maturity. Progenetic organisms achieve sexual maturity in their juvenile state. This is most commonly found among certain [[amphibia]]ns and [[insect]]s.

{{Onesource|article|date=August 2008}}'''Hormonal imprinting''' (HI) is a  phenomenon which takes place at the first encounter between a [[hormone]] and its developing [[hormone receptor|receptor]] in the critical periods of life (in unicellulars during the whole life) and determines the later [[signal transduction]] capacity of the cell. The most important period in [[mammals]] is the [[perinatal]] one, however this system can be imprinted at [[weaning]], at [[puberty]] and in case of continuously dividing cells during the whole life. Faulty imprinting is caused by [[drugs]], environmental [[pollutants]] and other hormone-like molecules  present in excess at the critical periods with life-long receptorial, morphological, biochemical and behavioral consequences. HI is transmitted to the hundreds of progeny generations in unicellulars and (as proved) to a few generations also in mammals.

A '''gamete''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''γαμέτης''; translated ''gamete'' = wife, ''gametes'' = husband) is a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that fuses with another gamete during [[fertilization]] (conception) in [[organism]]s that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]]. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a [[female]] is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete — called an [[ovum]] (or egg) — and a [[male]] produces the smaller tadpole-like type — called a [[sperm]]. This is an example of [[anisogamy]] or [[heterogamy]], the condition wherein females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum is approximately 20 times larger than the human sperm cell). In contrast, [[isogamy]] is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for [[mating type]]. 
The name gamete was introduced by the [[Austria]]n biologist [[Gregor Mendel]].  Gametes carry half the [[genetic information]] of an individual, one [[chromosome]] of each type. In [[humans]], an ovum can carry  only [[X chromosome]] (of the X and [[Y chromosomes]]), whereas a sperm can carry either an X or a Y; hence, it has been suggested that males have the control of the [[sex]] of any resulting [[zygote]], as the [[genotype]] of the sex-determining chromosomes of a male must be XY and a female XX.  In other words,  due to the presence of the Y chromosome exclusively in the sperm, it is that gamete alone that can determine that an offspring will be a male.

==Gametogenesis==
{{Main|Gametogenesis}}
[[Image:Gray7.png|thumb|Scheme showing analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the development of the spermatids.]]
The production of gameotypes is termed ''gametogenesis'', during which phase [[gametocyte]]s divide by [[meiosis]] into gametes. Meiosis reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two to one (i.e., produces haploid gametes from diploid gametocytes). Organs that produce gametes are called [[gonad]]s in animals, and [[archegonium|archegonia]] or [[antheridium|antheridia]] in plants.

==Gamete cycle==
A gamete of two generation ultimately creates a gamete in the next generation, but still keeping the same quantity of genetic information.

Gametes are [[haploid]] cells; that is, they contain half(n) of a complete set of [[chromosome]]s (the actual number varies from species to species). When two gametes fuse (in animals typically involving a sperm and an egg), they form a ''[[zygote]]''—a cell that has a complete set of chromosomes(2n) and therefore is [[diploid]]. The zygote receives one set of chromosomes from each of the two gametes through the fusion of the two gamete [[cell nucleus|nuclei]].  After multiple [[cell division]]s and [[cellular differentiation]], a zygote [[developmental biology|develops]], first into an [[embryo]], and ultimately into a mature individual capable of producing gametes.

==Sperm-egg distinction==
Eggs are relatively few, large, and immobile, whereas sperm are many, small, and motile.  The size difference is mostly (but not entirely) accounted for by the very large [[cytoplasm]] of the egg.  Eggs awaiting zygote formation may be anchored either to something in the environment or by an organ that contains them; sperm may rely solely on their own motility or may be relayed into place by an organ such as [[pollen]] to reach the place of zygote formation.  Typically many more sperm than eggs are created and wasted, in the sense of never fusing with a partner gamete.

The sperm/egg distinction is the basis for distinguishing between males and females. Since some algae and fungi have sexual reproduction by combining two identical gametes, there is no male/female distinction in these species. This raises the question as to why most large/familiar species reproduce by sperm and egg. One theory for why the male/female distinction is  so common is that it facilitated encounters between gametes, in ancestral marine species.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Ch. 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. ISBN 978-0-674-03116-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissimilarity==
In contrast to a gamete, the diploid [[somatic cell]]s of an individual contain one copy of the chromosome set from the sperm and one copy of the chromosome set from the egg; that is, the cells of the offspring have genes expressing characteristics of both the ''father'' and the ''mother''. A gamete's chromosomes are not exact duplicates of either of the sets of chromosomes carried in the somatic cells of the individual that produced the gametes. They can be ''hybrids'' produced through [[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]] (a form of [[genetic recombination]]) of chromosomes, which takes place in meiosis. This hybridization has a random element, and the chromosomes tend to be a little different in every gamete that an individual produces. This recombination and the fact that the two chromosome sets ultimately come from either a grandmother or a grandfather on each parental side account for the [[genetics|genetic]] dissimilarity of [[Family|siblings]].

The '''CoRR hypothesis''' states that the location of [[genetic information]] in [[cytoplasmic]] [[organelles]] permits regulation of its expression by the [[reduction-oxidation]] (&quot;[[redox]]&quot;) state of its [[gene product]]s.

'''CoRR''' is short for &quot;'''Co'''-location for '''R'''edox '''R'''egulation&quot;, itself a shortened form of &quot;'''Co'''-location (of gene and gene product) for (evolutionary) continuity of '''R'''edox '''R'''egulation of [[gene expression]].&quot;
 
'''CoRR''' was put forward explicitly in 1993 in a paper in the [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] with the title ''Control of gene expression by redox potential and the requirement for chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes'' &lt;ref&gt;Allen JF (1993) Control of gene expression by redox potential and the requirement for chloroplast and mitochondrial [[genomes]]. Journal of Theoretical Biology 165: 609-631&lt;/ref&gt;. The central concept had been outlined in a review of 1992 &lt;ref&gt;Allen JF (1992) Protein-Phosphorylation in Regulation of Photosynthesis. Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta 1098: 275-335&lt;/ref&gt;. The term '''CoRR''' was introduced in 2003 in a paper in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] entitled ''The function of genomes in bioenergetic organelles'' &lt;ref&gt;Allen JF (2003) The function of genomes in bioenergetic organelles. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 358: 19-37&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The problem ==

'''Chloroplasts and mitochondria'''. 
[[Chloroplasts]] and [[mitochondria]] are energy-converting [[organelles]] in the [[cytoplasm]] of [[eukaryotic cells]]. [[Chloroplasts]] in [[plant cells]] perform [[photosynthesis]]; the capture and conversion of the [[energy]] of [[sunlight]]. [[Mitochondria]] in both plant and[[ animal cells]] perform [[respiration]]; the release of this stored energy when work is done. In addition to these key reactions of [[bioenergetics]], chloroplasts and mitochondria each contain small, specialised and discrete genetic systems. These genetic systems enable chloroplasts and mitochondria to make some of their own [[proteins]]. Both the genetic and energy-converting systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria are descended, with little modification, from those of the free-living [[bacteria]] that these organelles once were. The existence of these cytoplasmic [[genomes]] is consistent with, and counts as evidence for, the [[endosymbiont hypothesis]].  Most genes for proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are, however, now located on [[chromosomes]] in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. There they code for protein precursors that are made in the [[cytosol]] for subsequent import into the organelles. 

'''Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genetic systems?''' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts require their own separate genetic systems, when other organelles that share the same cytoplasm, such as peroxisomes and lysosomes, do not? The question is not trivial, because maintaining a separate genetic system is costly: more than 90 proteins ... must be encoded by nuclear genes specifically for this purpose. ... The reason for such a costly arrangement is not clear, and the hope that the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes would provide the answer has proved to be unfounded. We cannot think of compelling reasons why the proteins made in mitochondria and chloroplasts should be made there rather than in the cytosol.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
Quoted from Alberts et al. ''The Molecular Biology of the Cell''. Garland Science. All editions &lt;ref&gt;Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, and Walter P Molecular Biology of the Cell. Fifth Edition. New York and London: Garland Science; 2007&lt;/ref&gt; including [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=mitochondria,chloroplasts&amp;rid=mboc4.section.2599#2636 4th Edition on-line]. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Cytoplasmic inheritance'''. 
CoRR seeks to explain why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain [[DNA]], and thus why some characters are inherited through the [[cytoplasm]] in the phenomenon of [[cytoplasmic]], non-[[Mendelian]], uniparental, or [[maternal inheritance]].  CoRR does so by offering an answer to this question; why, in [[evolution]], did some bacterial, [[endosymbiont]] genes move to the [[cell nucleus]], while others did not?

== Proposed solution ==

'''CoRR''' states that [[chloroplasts]] and [[mitochondria]] contain those [[genes]] whose expression is required to be under the direct, regulatory control of the [[redox]] state of their gene products, or of [[electron]] carriers with which those gene products interact. Such genes comprise a core, or primary subset, of organellar genes. The requirement for redox control of each gene in the primary subset then confers an advantage upon location of that gene within the organelle. [[Natural selection]] therefore anchors some genes in organelles, while favouring location of others in the cell nucleus.  Chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also contain genes for components of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genetic systems themselves. These genes comprise a secondary subset of organellar genes; genetic system genes. There is generally no requirement for redox control of expression of genetic system genes, though their being subject to redox control may, in some cases, allow [[amplification]] of [[redox]] signals acting upon [[genes]] in the primary subset (bioenergetic genes). Retention of genes of the secondary subset (genetic system genes) is necessary for the operation of redox control of expression of genes in the primary subset. If all genes disappear from the primary subset, '''CoRR''' predicts that there is no function for genes in the secondary subset, and such organelles will then, eventually, lose their genomes completely. However, if even only one gene remains under redox control, then an organelle genetic system is required for the synthesis of its single gene product.

== Evidence==

* Different products of [[protein synthesis]] in isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria are obtained in the presence of redox reagents with different [[redox potential]]s &lt;ref&gt;Allen CA, Hakansson G, Allen JF (1995) Redox Conditions Specify the Proteins Synthesized by Isolated-Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. Redox Report 1: 119-123&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Natural selection''' is the process where [[heritable]] [[trait (biology)|traits]] that make it more likely for an [[organism]] to survive and successfully [[Reproduction|reproduce]] become more common over successive generations of a population. It is a key mechanism of [[evolution]]. 

The natural [[genetic variability|genetic variation]] within a population of organisms means that some individuals will survive and reproduce more successfully than others in their current [[ecosystem|environment]]. For example, the [[peppered moth]] exists in both light and dark colors in the [[United Kingdom]], but during the [[industrial revolution]] many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-colored moths an advantage in hiding from [[predators]]. This gave dark-colored moths a better chance of surviving to produce dark-colored offspring, and in just a few generations the majority of the moths were dark. Factors which affect reproductive success are also important, an issue which Darwin developed in his ideas on [[sexual selection]].
 
Natural selection acts on the [[phenotype]], or the observable characteristics of an organism, but the [[genetic]] (heritable) basis of any phenotype which gives a reproductive advantage will increase in frequency over the following generations (see [[allele frequency]]). Over time, this process can result in [[adaptation]]s that specialize organisms for particular [[ecological niche]]s and may eventually result in the [[speciation|emergence of new species]]. In other words, natural selection is an important process (though not the only process) by which evolution takes place within a population of organisms.

Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern [[biology]]. The term was introduced by [[Charles Darwin]] in his groundbreaking 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=origin&gt; Darwin C (1859) ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'' John Murray, London; modern reprint {{cite book|author = Charles Darwin, Julian Huxley|year = 2003|title = The Origin of Species| publisher = Signet Classics|isbn = 0-451-52906-5}} Published online at [http://darwin-online.org.uk/ The complete work of Charles Darwin online]: [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=2 On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life]. &lt;/ref&gt; in which natural selection was described by analogy to [[artificial selection]], a process by which animals with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of [[heredity]]; at the time of Darwin's writing, nothing was known of modern genetics.  The union of traditional [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] with subsequent discoveries in [[classical genetics|classical]] and [[molecular genetics]] is termed the ''[[modern evolutionary synthesis]]''. Natural selection remains the primary explanation for [[adaptive evolution]].

==General principles==

[[Image:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] illustrations of beak variation in the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] of the [[Galápagos Islands]], which hold 13 closely related [[species]] that differ most markedly in the shape of their beaks. The beak of each species is suited to its preferred food, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection.]]

There is natural variation among the individuals of any population of organisms. Many of these differences do not affect survival (such as differences in eye color), but some differences may improve the chances of survival of a particular individual. A rabbit which runs faster than others may be more likely to escape from predators, and an [[algae]] which is more efficient at extracting the energy from sunlight will grow faster. Individuals that have better odds for survival also have better odds for reproduction. If the traits which give these individuals a reproductive advantage are also heritable, that is, passed from parent to child, then there will be a slightly higher proportion of fast rabbits or efficient algae in the next generation. This is known as ''differential reproduction''. Even if the reproductive advantage is very slight, over many generations any heritable advantage will become dominant in the population, due to [[exponential growth]]. In this way the natural environment of an organism &quot;selects&quot; for traits that confer a reproductive advantage, causing gradual changes or evolution of life. This effect was first described, and named, by Charles Darwin. 
 
The concept of natural selection predates the understanding of genetics, which is the study of heredity. In modern times, it is understood that selection acts on an organism's phenotype, or observable characteristics, but it is the organism's genetic make-up or [[genotype]] which is inherited. The phenotype is the result of the genotype and the environment in which the organism lives (see  [[Genotype-phenotype distinction]]). This is the link between natural selection and genetics, as described in the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Although a complete [[theory of evolution]] also requires an account of how genetic variation arises in the first place (such as by [[mutation]] and [[sexual reproduction]]) and includes other evolutionary mechanisms (such as [[gene flow]]), natural selection is still understood as a fundamental mechanism for evolution. 
 
===Nomenclature and usage===
The term ''natural selection'' has slightly different definitions in different contexts. It is most often defined to operate on heritable traits, because these are the traits that directly participate in evolution. However, natural selection is &quot;blind&quot; in the sense that changes in phenotype (physical and behavioral characteristics) can give a reproductive advantage regardless of whether or not the trait is heritable (non heritable traits can be the result of environmental factors or the life experience of the organism). 

Following Darwin's primary usage&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot; /&gt; the term is often used to refer to both the evolutionary consequence of blind selection and to its mechanisms.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher RA (1930) ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''  Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature1&quot;&gt;Works employing or describing this usage:&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author=Endler JA | year=1986| title=Natural Selection in the Wild| publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]| location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]| isbn=0-691-00057-3}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author=Williams GC| year=1966| title=[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes helpful to explicitly distinguish between selection's mechanisms and its effects; when this distinction is important, scientists define &quot;natural selection&quot; specifically as &quot;those mechanisms that contribute to the selection of individuals that reproduce&quot;, without regard to whether the basis of the selection is heritable. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;phenotypic natural selection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclature2&quot;&gt;Works employing or describing this usage:&lt;br&gt;Lande R &amp; Arnold SJ (1983) The measurement of selection on correlated characters. [[Evolution (journal)|''Evolution'']] 37:1210-26&lt;br&gt;[[Douglas J. Futuyma|Futuyma DJ]] (2005) ''Evolution''. Sinauer Associates, Inc., [[Sunderland, Massachusetts|Sunderland]], [[Massachusetts]]. ISBN 0-87893-187-2&lt;br&gt;Haldane, J.B.S. 1953. The measurement of natural selection. Proceedings of the 9th International Congress of Genetics. 1: 480-487&lt;/ref&gt;

Traits that cause greater reproductive success of an organism are said to be selected for, whereas those that reduce success are selected against. Selection for a trait may also result in the selection of other correlated traits that do not themselves directly influence reproductive advantage. This may occur as a result of [[pleiotropy]] or [[gene linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott Sober|Sober E]] (1984; 1993) ''The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus'' [[University of Chicago Press]] ISBN 0-226-76748-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitness===
{{main|Fitness (biology)}}
The concept of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is central to natural selection. Broadly, individuals which are more &quot;fit&quot; have better potential for survival, as in the well-known phrase &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;. However, as with natural selection above, the precise meaning of the term is much more subtle, and [[Richard Dawkins]] manages in his later books to avoid it entirely. (He devotes a chapter of his book, ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'', to discussing the various senses in which the term is used). Modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes will become more common in the adult population of the next generation.

Though natural selection acts on individuals, the effects of chance mean that fitness can only really be defined &quot;on average&quot; for the individuals within a population. The fitness of a particular genotype corresponds to the average effect on all individuals with that genotype. Very low-fitness genotypes cause their bearers to have few or no offspring on average; examples include many human [[genetic disorder]]s like [[cystic fibrosis]]. Since fitness is an averaged quantity, it is also possible that a favorable mutation arises in an individual that does not survive to adulthood for unrelated reasons. Fitness also depends crucially upon the environment. Conditions like [[sickle-cell anemia]] may have low fitness in the general human population, but because [[sickle-cell anemia]] confers immunity from malaria, it has high fitness value in populations which have high malaria infection rates.

===Types of selection===
Natural selection can act on any phenotypic trait, and selective pressure can be produced by any aspect of the environment, including [[sexual selection]] and [[Competition#Biology and ecology|competition]] with members of the same species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants. 

The [[unit of selection]] can be the individual or it can be another level within the hierarchy of biological organisation, such as genes, [[cell (biology)|cells]], and [[kin selection|kin groups]]. There is still debate about whether natural selection acts at the level of [[group selection|groups or species]] to produce adaptations that benefit a larger, non-kin group. Selection at a different level such as the gene can result in an increase in fitness for that gene, while at the same time reducing the fitness of the individuals carrying that gene, in a process called [[intragenomic conflict]].  Overall, the combined effect of all selection pressures at various levels determines the overall fitness of an individual, and hence the outcome of natural selection.

[[Image:Life cycle of a sexually reproducing organism.svg|thumb|right|The life cycle of a sexually reproducing organism. Various components of natural selection are indicated for each life stage.&lt;ref&gt;Modified from Christiansen FB (1984) The definition and measurement of fitness. In: ''[[Evolutionary ecology]]'' (ed. Shorrocks B) pp65-79. [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell Scientific]], [[Oxford]] by adding survival selection in the reproductive phase&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Natural selection occurs at every life stage of an individual. An individual organism must survive until adulthood before it can reproduce, and selection of those that reach this stage is called ''viability selection''. In many species, adults must compete with each other for mates via sexual selection, and success in this competition determines who will parent the next generation. When individuals can reproduce more than once, a longer survival in the reproductive phase increases the number of offspring, called ''survival selection''. The [[fecundity]] of both females and males (for example, giant [[spermatozoon|sperm]] in certain species of ''[[Drosophila]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Pitnick S &amp; Markow TA (1994) Large-male advantage associated with the costs of sperm production in ''Drosophila hydei'', a species with giant sperm. [[PNAS|''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'']] 91:9277-81; Pitnick S (1996) Investment in testes and the cost of making long sperm in ''Drosophila''. [[American Naturalist|''Am Nat'']] 148:57-80&lt;/ref&gt; can be limited via &quot;fecundity selection&quot;. The viability of produced [[gamete]]s can differ, while intragenomic conflicts such as meiotic drive between the [[haploid]] gametes can result in gametic or &quot;genic selection&quot;. Finally, the union of some combinations of eggs and sperm might be more compatible than others; this is termed ''compatibility selection''.

===Sexual selection===
{{main|Sexual selection}}
It is useful to distinguish between &quot;[[ecological selection]]&quot; and &quot;sexual selection&quot;. Ecological selection covers any mechanism of selection as a result of the environment (including relatives, e.g. [[kin selection]], [[Competition (biology)|competition]], and [[infanticide]]), while &quot;sexual selection&quot; refers specifically to competition for mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Andersson, M| year=1995| title=Sexual Selection| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, New Jersey| isbn=0-691-00057-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual selection can be ''intrasexual'', as in cases of competition among individuals of the same sex in a population, or ''intersexual'', as in cases where one sex controls reproductive access by choosing among a population of available mates. Most commonly, intrasexual selection involves male–male competition and intersexual selection involves female choice of suitable males, due to the generally greater investment of resources for a female than a male in a single offspring. However, some species exhibit sex-role reversed behavior in which it is males that are most selective in mate choice; the best-known examples of this pattern occur in some fishes of the family ''[[Syngnathidae]]'', though likely examples have also been found in amphibian and bird species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eens&quot;&gt;Eens M, Pinxten R. (2000). Sex-role reversal in vertebrates: behavioural and endocrinological accounts. ''Behav Processes'' 51(1-3):135-147. PMID 11074317 &lt;/ref&gt; Some features that are confined to one sex only of a particular species can be explained by selection exercised by the other sex in the choice of a mate, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds. Similarly, aggression between members of the same sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of [[stag]]s, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with [[sexual dimorphism]], including differences in body size between males and females of a species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;&gt;Barlow GW. (2005). How Do We Decide that a Species is Sex-Role Reversed? ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'' 80(1):28–35. PMID 15884733 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of natural selection==

[[Image:Antibiotic resistance.svg|thumb|upright|Resistance to antibiotics is increased though the survival of individuals which are immune to the effects of the antibiotic, whose offspring then inherit the resistance, creating a new population of resistant bacteria.]]
A well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in [[microorganism]]s. Since the discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928 by [[Alexander Fleming]], [[antibiotic]]s have been used to fight [[bacteria]]l diseases. Natural populations of bacteria contain, among their vast numbers of individual members, considerable variation in their genetic material, primarily as the result of mutations. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible. If the exposure to antibiotics is short, these individuals will survive the treatment. This selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection. 

These surviving bacteria will then reproduce again, producing the next generation. Due to the elimination of the maladapted individuals in the past generation, this population contains more bacteria that have some resistance against the antibiotic. At the same time, new mutations occur, contributing new genetic variation to the existing genetic variation. Spontaneous mutations are very rare, and advantageous mutations are even rarer. However, populations of bacteria are large enough that a few individuals will have beneficial mutations. If a new mutation reduces their susceptibility to an antibiotic, these individuals are more likely to survive when next confronted with that antibiotic. Given enough time, and repeated exposure to the antibiotic, a population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge. 

The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics has resulted in increased microbial resistance to antibiotics in clinical use, to the point that the [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) has been described as a &quot;superbug&quot; because of the threat it poses to health and its relative invulnerability to existing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inboxrobot.com/news/MRSASuperbug|title=MRSA Superbug News|accessdate=2006-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Response strategies typically include the use of different, stronger antibiotics; however, new [[strain (biology)|strains]] of MRSA have recently emerged that are resistant even to these drugs.&lt;ref name=Schito_2006&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schito GC | title=The importance of the development of antibiotic resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' | journal=Clin Microbiol Infect | year=2006|pages=3–8|volume=12 Suppl 1|pmid=16445718 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01343.x }} [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01343.x]&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of what is known as an [[evolutionary arms race]], in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. A similar situation occurs with [[pesticide resistance]] in plants and insects. Arms races are not necessarily induced by man; a well-documented example involves the elaboration of the [[RNA interference]] pathway in plants as means of [[innate immunity]] against [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy&quot;&gt;Lucy A, Guo H, Li W, Ding S (2000). &quot;Suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing by a plant viral protein localized in the nucleus&quot;. ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO J]]'' '''19''' (7): 1672–80. PMID 10747034. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution by means of natural selection==
{{main|Evolution|Darwinism}}
A prerequisite for natural selection to result in [[adaptation|adaptive evolution]], novel traits and speciation, is the presence of heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, [[genetic recombination|recombination]]s and alterations in the [[karyotype]] (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the [[chromosome]]s). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are very rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in [[noncoding DNA]] or resulted in a [[synonymous substitution]]. However, recent research suggests that many mutations in non-coding DNA do have slight deleterious effects.&lt;ref name=NCFitnessEffects/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCFitnessEffects2/&gt; Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, estimates from data in [[human]]s have found that a majority of mutations are slightly deleterious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyre-Walker&quot;&gt;Eyre-Walker A, Woolfit M, Phelps T. (2006). The distribution of fitness effects of new deleterious amino acid mutations in humans. ''Genetics'' 173(2):891-900. PMID 16547091 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pavo cristatus albino001xx.jpg|left|thumb|The exuberant tail of the [[peacock]] is thought to be the result of sexual selection by females. This peacock is an [[albino]]; selection against albinos in nature is intense because they are easily spotted by predators or are unsuccessful in competition for mates.]]

By the definition of fitness, individuals with greater fitness are more likely to contribute offspring to the next generation, while individuals with lesser fitness are more likely to die early or fail to reproduce. As a result, alleles which on average result in greater fitness become more abundant in the next generation, while alleles which generally reduce fitness become rarer. If the selection forces remain the same for many generations, beneficial alleles become more and more abundant, until they dominate the population, while alleles with a lesser fitness disappear. In every generation, new mutations and recombinations arise spontaneously, producing a new spectrum of phenotypes. Therefore, each new generation will be enriched by the increasing abundance of alleles that contribute to those traits that were favored by selection, enhancing these traits over successive generations. 

Some mutations occur in so-called [[regulatory sequence|regulatory genes]]. Changes in these can have large effects on the phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in non-viable [[zygote]]s. Examples of nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in [[Homeobox|HOX genes]] in humans, which can result in a [[cervical rib]]&lt;ref&gt;Galis F (1999) Why do almost all mammals have seven cervical [[vertebrae]]? developmental constraints, Hox genes, and cancer. ''J Exp Zool'' 285:19-26&lt;/ref&gt; or [[polydactyly]], an increase in the number of fingers or toes.&lt;ref&gt;Zakany J, FromentalRamain C, Warot X &amp; Duboule D (1997) Regulation of number and size of digits by posterior Hox genes: a dose-dependent mechanism with potential evolutionary implications. [[PNAS|''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'']] 94:13695-700&lt;/ref&gt; When such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection will favor these phenotypes and the novel trait will spread in the population. 
[[Image:Polydactyly 01 Lhand AP.jpg|upright|thumb|X-ray of the left hand of a ten year old boy with [[polydactyly]].]]

Established traits are not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one environmental context may be much less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it will become more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a [[vestigial structure|vestigial]] manifestation of the trait. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as [[preadaptation]]. A famous example of a vestigial structure, the [[eye]] of the [[blind mole rat]], is believed to retain function in [[photoperiod]] perception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanyal&quot;&gt;Sanyal S, Jansen HG, de Grip WJ, Nevo E, de Jong WW. (1990). The eye of the blind mole rat, Spalax ehrenbergi. Rudiment with hidden function? ''Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.'' 1990 31(7):1398-404. PMID 2142147 &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Speciation===
[[Speciation]] requires selective mating, which result in a reduced [[gene flow]]. Selective mating can be the result of, for example, a change in the physical environment (physical isolation by an extrinsic barrier), or by sexual selection resulting in [[assortative mating]]. Over time, these subgroups might diverge radically to become different species, either because of differences in selection pressures on the different subgroups, or because different mutations arise spontaneously in the different populations, or because of [[founder effect]]s - some potentially beneficial alleles may, by chance, be present in only one or other of two subgroups when they first become separated. A lesser-known mechanism of speciation occurs via [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization, well-documented in plants and occasionally observed in species-rich groups of animals such as [[cichlid]] fishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salzburger&quot;&gt;Salzburger W, Baric S, Sturmbauer C. (2002). Speciation via introgressive hybridization in East African cichlids? ''Mol Ecol'' 11(3): 619–625. PMID 11918795 &lt;/ref&gt; Such mechanisms of rapid speciation can reflect a mechanism of evolutionary change known as [[punctuated equilibrium]], which suggests that evolutionary change and particularly speciation typically happens quickly after interrupting long periods of stasis.

Genetic changes within groups result in increasing incompatibility between the genomes of the two subgroups, thus reducing gene flow between the groups. Gene flow will effectively cease when the distinctive mutations characterizing each subgroup become fixed. As few as two mutations can result in speciation: if each mutation has a neutral or positive effect on fitness when they occur separately, but a negative effect when they occur together, then fixation of these genes in the respective subgroups will lead to two reproductively isolated populations. According to the biological species concept, these will be two different species.

==Historical development==
{{main|History of evolutionary thought|Inception of Darwin's theory|Development of Darwin's theory}}
[[Image:Charles Darwin aged 51.jpg|right|thumb|The modern theory of natural selection derives from the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the nineteenth century.]]

===Pre-Darwinian theories=== 
Several ancient philosophers expressed the idea that nature produces a huge variety of creatures, apparently randomly, and that only those creatures survive that manage to provide for themselves and reproduce successfully; well-known examples include [[Empedocles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | last = Empedocles | authorlink = Empedocles | title = [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/presoc/emp.htm On Nature] | volume = Book II}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his intellectual successor, [[Lucretius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Lucretius | authorlink = Lucretius | title = [http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.5.v.html De rerum natura] | volume = Book V}}&lt;/ref&gt; while related ideas were later refined by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Aristotle | title = [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html Physics] | volume = Book II, Chapters 4 and 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[On the Origin of Species#Struggle for existence, and natural selection|struggle for existence]] was later described by [[al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Zirkle (1941). Natural Selection before the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''84''' (1), p. 71-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Bayrakdar (Third Quarter, 1983). &quot;Al-Jahiz And the Rise of Biological Evolutionism&quot;, ''The Islamic Quarterly''. [[London]].&lt;/ref&gt; Such classical arguments were reintroduced in the 18th century by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Maupertuis | first = Pierre Louis | authorlink = Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis | date = 1748 | title = [[s:Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle#I.

While these forerunners had an influence on Darwinism, they later had little influence on the trajectory of evolutionary thought after Charles Darwin.

Until the early 19th century, the [[History of creationism#Renaissance to Darwin|prevailing view]] in Western societies was that differences between individuals of a species were uninteresting departures from their [[Platonic ideal]]ism (or typus) of [[created kind]]s. However, the theory of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] in [[geology]] promoted the idea that simple, weak forces could act continuously over long periods of time to produce radical changes in the Earth's landscape. The success of this theory raised awareness of the vast scale of [[geological time]] and made plausible the idea that tiny, virtually imperceptible changes in successive generations could produce consequences on the scale of differences between species. Early 19th century evolutionists such as [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] suggested the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] as a mechanism for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Chevalier de Lamarck J-B, de Monet PA]] (1809) ''Philosophie Zoologique''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has come to be known as [[Lamarckism]] and was an influence on the anti-genetic ideas of the [[Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biologist [[Trofim Lysenko]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Joravsky&quot;&gt;Joravsky D. (1959). Soviet Marxism and Biology before Lysenko. ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 20(1):85-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's theory===
In 1859, Charles Darwin set out his theory of evolution by natural selection as an explanation for adaptation and speciation. He defined natural selection as the &quot;principle by which each slight variation [of a trait], if useful, is preserved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=76 61]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. As long as there is some variation between them, there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations. If the variations are inherited, then differential reproductive success will lead to a progressive evolution of particular populations of a species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Darwin's ideas were inspired by the observations that he had made on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]], and by the work of two political economists. The first was the Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]], who in ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', noted that population (if unchecked) increases exponentially whereas the food supply grows only [[linear function|arithmetically]]; thus inevitable limitations of resources would have demographic implications, leading to a &quot;struggle for existence&quot; as a divinely ordained law &quot;in order to rouse man into action, and form his mind to reason&quot; for the greater good despite the &quot;partial evil&quot; limiting population.&lt;ref name=June29&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Malthus/Essay.htm#112 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |author=T. Robert Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |date=1798 |work=June 29, 1999 |publisher= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was [[Adam Smith]] who, in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', identified a regulating mechanism in free markets, which he referred to as the &quot;[[invisible hand]]&quot;, which suggests that prices self-adjust according to supplies and demand.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Orrell|Orrell, David]] (2007) ''Apollo's Arrow'' Toronto: HarperCollins Publishers Ltd. [http://www.apollosarrow.ca/]&lt;/ref&gt; When Darwin read Malthus in 1838 he was already primed by his work as a naturalist to appreciate the &quot;struggle for existence&quot; in nature and it struck him that as population outgrew resources, &quot;favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species.&quot;&lt;ref name=auto120&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=124 |title=The autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809-1882 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin |coauthors=ed. [[Nora Barlow]] |date=1958 |publisher=London: Collins |pages=120 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he had his theory &quot;by which to work&quot;, Darwin was meticulous about gathering and refining evidence as his &quot;prime hobby&quot; before making his idea public. He was in the process of writing his &quot;big book&quot; to  present his researches when the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] independently conceived of the principle and described it in an essay he sent to Darwin to forward to [[Charles Lyell]]. Lyell and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] decided (without Wallace's knowledge) to present his essay together with unpublished writings which Darwin had sent to fellow naturalists, and ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]'' was read to the [[Linnean Society]] announcing co-discovery of the principle in July 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace, Alfred Russel]] (1870) ''Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection'' New York: Macmillan &amp; Co. [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa&amp;idno=AJP5195.0001.001&amp;view=toc]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin published a detailed account of his evidence and conclusions in ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. In the 3rd edition of 1861 Darwin acknowledged that others &amp;mdash; notably [[William Charles Wells]] in 1813, and [[Patrick Matthew]] in 1831 &amp;mdash; had proposed similar ideas, but had neither developed them nor presented them in notable scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F381&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=20 xiii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin thought of natural selection by analogy to how farmers select crops or livestock for breeding, which he called &quot;artificial selection&quot;; in his early manuscripts he referred to a 'Nature' which would do the selection. At the time, other mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not yet explicitly formulated, and Darwin believed that selection was likely only part of the story: &quot;I am convinced that [it] has been the main, but not exclusive means of  modification.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=21 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted the use of the term &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, preferring the term &quot;Natural Preservation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2931.html | title=Darwin Correspondence Online Database: Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 28 September 1860 | accessdate=2006-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural selection was essentially synonymous with evolution by natural selection. After the publication of ''The Origin of Species'', educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its &quot;unguided&quot; and non-progressive nature,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisley&quot;&gt;Eisley L. (1958). ''Darwin's Century: Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It.''

[1962] (1996). ''The Structure of Scientific Revolution'' 3rd ed. University of Chicago Press: Chicago, Illinois, USA. ISBN 0-226-45808-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, [[Herbert Spencer]] introduced the term ''survival of the fittest'', which became a popular summary of the theory.&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://educ.southern.edu/tour/who/pioneers/spencer.html |title=Pioneers of Psychology [2001 Tour] - School of Education &amp; Psychology |accessdate=2007-08-29 |format= |work=}}&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{cite web |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=maurice_stucke |title=Better Competition Advocacy |accessdate=2007-08-29 |author=Maurice E.

===Modern evolutionary synthesis===
{{main|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}
Natural selection relies crucially on the idea of heredity, but it was developed long before the basic concepts of genetics. Although Austrian monk [[Gregor Mendel]], the father of modern genetics, was a contemporary of Darwin's, his work would lie in obscurity until the early 20th century. Only after the integration of Darwin's theory of evolution with a complex statistical appreciation of Gregor Mendel's 're-discovered' laws of inheritance did natural selection become generally accepted by scientists. The work of [[Ronald Fisher]] (who developed the required mathematical language and [[the genetical theory of natural selection]]),&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt; [[J.B.S. Haldane]] (who introduced the concept of the &quot;cost&quot; of natural selection),&lt;ref&gt;Haldane JBS (1932) ''[[The Causes of Evolution]]''; Haldane JBS (1957) The cost of natural selection. ''[[Journal of Genetics|J Genet]]'' '''55''':511-24([http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane2.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sewall Wright]] (who elucidated the nature of selection and adaptation),&lt;ref&gt;Wright S (1932) [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution] ''Proc 6th Int Cong Genet'' 1:356–66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (who established the idea that mutation, by creating genetic diversity, supplied the raw material for natural selection: see [[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky Th (1937) ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' Columbia University Press, New York. (2nd ed., 1941; 3rd edn., 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]] (who conceived of kin selection), [[Ernst Mayr]] (who recognised the key importance of reproductive isolation for speciation: see [[Systematics and the Origin of Species]])&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E (1942) ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'' Columbia University Press, New York. ISBN 0-674-86250-3&lt;/ref&gt; and many others formed the modern evolutionary synthesis. This synthesis cemented natural selection as the foundation of evolutionary theory, where it remains today.

==Impact of the idea==
Darwin's ideas, along with those of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]], had a profound influence on 19th century thought. Perhaps the most radical claim of the theory of evolution through natural selection is that &quot;elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner&quot; evolved from the simplest forms of life by a few simple principles. This claim inspired some of Darwin's most ardent supporters&amp;mdash;and provoked the most profound opposition. The radicalism of natural selection, according to [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 The New York Review of Books: Darwinian Fundamentalism] (accessed May 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; lay in its power to &quot;dethrone some of the deepest and most traditional comforts of Western thought&quot;. In particular, it challenged long-standing beliefs in such concepts as a special and exalted place for humans in the natural world and a benevolent creator whose intentions were reflected in nature's order and design.

===Social and psychological theory===
The social implications of the theory of evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. [[Friedrich Engels]], a German [[political philosopher]] and co-originator of the ideology of [[communism]], wrote in 1872 that &quot;Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engels]] F (1873-86) ''Dialectics of Nature''  3d ed. Moscow: Progress, 1964 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of natural selection as necessarily 'progressive', leading to increasing 'advances' in intelligence and civilisation, was used as a justification for [[colonialism]] and policies of [[eugenics]], as well as broader sociopolitical positions now described as [[Social Darwinism]]. [[Konrad Lorenz]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1973 for his analysis of animal behavior in terms of the role of natural selection (particularly group selection). However, in Germany in 1940, in writings that he subsequently disowned, he used the theory as a justification for policies of the [[Nazi]] state. He wrote &quot;... selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility...must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Quoted in translation in Eisenberg L (2005) Which image for Lorenz? ''Am J Psychiatry'' 162:1760 [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/9/1760]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture [[evolution of societies|evolve]] by mechanisms that are analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Wilson, DS (2002) ''Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society''. University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-90134-3 &lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, work among anthropologists and psychologists has led to the development of [[sociobiology]] and later [[evolutionary psychology]], a field that attempts to explain features of [[human psychology]] in terms of adaptation to the ancestral environment. The most prominent such example, notably advanced in the early work of [[Noam Chomsky]] and later by [[Steven Pinker]], is the hypothesis that the human brain is adapted to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of [[natural language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinker&quot;&gt;Pinker S. [1994] (1995). ''The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language.'' HarperCollins: New York, NY, USA. ISBN 0-06-097651-9&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of human behavior and social structures, from specific cultural norms such as [[Westermarck effect#Westermarck effect|incest avoidance]] to broader patterns such as [[gender role]]s, have been hypothesized to have similar origins as adaptations to the early environment in which modern humans evolved. By analogy to the action of natural selection on genes, the concept of [[meme]]s - &quot;units of cultural transmission&quot;, or culture's equivalents of genes undergoing selection and recombination - has arisen, first described in this form by [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins&quot;&gt;Dawkins R. [1976] (1989). ''The Selfish Gene.'' Oxford University Press: New York, NY, USA, p.192. ISBN 0-19-286092-5&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently expanded upon by philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] as explanations for complex cultural activities, including human [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dennett&quot;&gt;Dennett DC. (1991). ''Consciousness Explained.'' Little, Brown, and Co: New York, NY, USA. ISBN 0-316-18066-1&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions of the theory of natural selection to such a wide range of cultural phenomena have been distinctly controversial and are not widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;For example, see Rose H, Rose SPR, Jencks C. (2000). ''Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology.'' Harmony Books. ISBN 0609605135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information and systems theory===
In 1922, [[Alfred J. Lotka|Alfred Lotka]] proposed that natural selection might be understood as a physical principle which could be described in terms of the use of [[energy]] by a system,&lt;ref&gt;Lotka AJ (1922a) [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1085052&amp;blobtype=pdf Contribution to the energetics of evolution] [PDF] ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'' 8:147–51&lt;br&gt;Lotka AJ (1922b) [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1085053&amp;blobtype=pdf Natural selection as a physical principle] [PDF] ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'' 8:151–4&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that was later developed by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] as the [[maximum power principle]] whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation. Such concepts are sometimes relevant in the study of applied [[thermodynamics]].

The principles of natural selection have inspired a variety of computational techniques, such as &quot;soft&quot; [[artificial life]], that simulate selective processes and can be highly efficient in 'adapting' entities to an environment defined by a specified [[fitness function]].&lt;ref&gt; [[Stuart Kauffman|Kauffman SA]] (1993) ''The Origin of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution.'' New York: Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-507951-5 &lt;/ref&gt; For example, a class of [[heuristic]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]s known as [[genetic algorithm]]s, pioneered by [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] in the 1970s and expanded upon by [[David E. Goldberg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg&quot;&gt;Goldberg DE. (1989). Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning. Addison-Wesley: Boston, MA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; identify optimal solutions by simulated reproduction and mutation of a population of solutions defined by an initial [[probability distribution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;&gt;Mitchell, Melanie, (1996), An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Such algorithms are particularly useful when applied to problems whose [[energy landscape|solution landscape]] is very rough or has many local minima.

==Genetic basis of natural selection==
The idea of natural selection predates the understanding of genetics. We now have a much better idea of the biology underlying heritability, which is the basis of natural selection.

===Genotype and Phenotype===
:''See also: [[Genotype-phenotype distinction]].''
Natural selection acts on an organism's phenotype, or physical characteristics.  Phenotype is determined by an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and the environment in which the organism lives.  Often, natural selection acts on specific traits of an individual, and the terms phenotype and genotype are used narrowly to indicate these specific traits.  

When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele.  It is this genetic variation that underlies phenotypic traits. A typical example is that certain combinations of genes for [[eye color]] in humans which, for instance, give rise to the phenotype of blue eyes. (On the other hand, when all the organisms in a population share the same allele for a particular trait, and this state is stable over time, the allele is said to be ''[[fixation (population genetics)|fixed]]'' in that population.)

Some traits are governed by only a single gene, but most traits are influenced by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can produce a continuum of possible phenotypic values.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer DS &amp; Mackay TFC (1996) ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics'' Addison Wesley Longman, Harlow, Essex, UK ISBN 0-582-24302-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directionality of selection===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Race and intelligence]] --&gt;
When some component of a trait is heritable, selection will alter the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection can be divided into three classes, on the basis of its effect on allele frequencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot;&gt;Rice SH. (2004). Evolutionary Theory: Mathematical and Conceptual Foundations. Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts, USA. ISBN 0-87893-702-1 See esp. ch. 5 and 6 for a quantitative treatment.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Directional selection]] occurs when a certain allele has a greater fitness than others, resulting in an increase in frequency of that allele. This process can continue until the allele is [[fixation (population genetics)|fixed]] and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. It is directional selection that is illustrated in the antibiotic resistance example [[#An example: antibiotic resistance|above]].

Far more common is [[stabilizing selection]] (also known as ''purifying selection''), which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype - that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection results in functional genetic features, such as [[protein biosynthesis|protein-coding genes]] or [[regulatory sequence]]s, being [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] over time due to selective pressure against deleterious variants. 

Finally, a number of forms of [[balancing selection]] exist, which do not result in fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in [[diploid]] species (that is, those that have two pairs of [[chromosome]]s) when [[heterozygote]] individuals, who have different alleles on each chromosome at a single [[Locus (genetics)|genetic locus]], have a higher fitness than [[homozygote]] individuals that have two of the same alleles. This is called [[heterozygote advantage]] or overdominance, of which the best-known example is the [[malaria]]l resistance observed in heterozygous humans who carry only one copy of the gene for [[sickle cell anemia]]. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through [[disruptive selection|disruptive or diversifying selection]], which favors genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of overdominance), and can result in a [[bimodal distribution]] of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through [[frequency-dependent selection]], where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of [[game theory]] have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of [[kin selection]] and the evolution of [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton&quot;&gt;Hamilton WD. (1964). The genetical evolution of social behaviour I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'' 7: 1-16 and 17-52. PMID 5875341  PMID 5875340 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trivers&quot;&gt;Trivers RL. (1971). The evolution of reciprocal altruism. ''Q Rev Biol'' 46: 35-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection and genetic variation===
A portion of all [[genetic variation]] is functionally neutral in that it produces no phenotypic effect or significant difference in fitness; the hypothesis that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed [[genetic diversity]] is known as the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] and was originated by [[Motoo Kimura]]. Neutral variation was once thought to encompass most of the genetic variation in [[non-coding DNA]], which was hypothesized to be composed of &quot;[[junk DNA]]&quot;. However, more recently, the functional roles of non-coding DNA, such as the regulatory and developmental functions of [[RNA]] [[gene product]]s, has been studied in depth;&lt;ref name=&quot;He&quot;&gt;He L, Hannon GJ. (2004). MicroRNAs: small RNAs with a big role in gene regulation. ''Nat Rev Genet'' 5(7):522-31. PMID 15211354 &lt;/ref&gt; large parts of non-protein-coding DNA sequences are highly conserved under strong purifying selection and thus do not vary much from individual to individual, indicating that mutations in these regions have deleterious consequences.&lt;ref name=NCFitnessEffects&gt;Kryukov GV, Schmidt S &amp; Sunyaev S (2005) Small fitness effect of mutations in highly conserved non-coding regions. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' 14:2221-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCFitnessEffects2&gt;Bejerano G, Pheasant M, Makunin I, Stephen S, Kent WJ, Mattick JS &amp; Haussler D (2004) Ultraconserved elements in the human genome. [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] 304:1321-5&lt;/ref&gt; When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot ''directly'' affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites will be higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot; /&gt;

====Mutation selection balance====
Natural selection results in the reduction of genetic variation through the elimination of maladapted individuals and consequently of the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a [[mutation-selection balance]]. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on the rate at which new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavorable the mutation proves to be. Consequently, changes in the mutation rate or the selection pressure will result in a different mutation-selection balance.

====Genetic linkage====
[[Genetic linkage]] occurs when the [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of two alleles are ''linked'', or in close proximity to each other on the chromosome. During the formation of [[gametes]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]] of the genetic material results in reshuffling of the alleles. However, the chance that such a reshuffle occurs between two alleles depends on the distance between those alleles; the closer the alleles are to each other, the less likely it is that such a reshuffle will occur. Consequently, when selection targets one allele, this automatically results in selection of the other allele as well; through this mechanism, selection can have a strong influence on patterns of variation in the genome.

[[Selective sweep]]s occur when an allele becomes more common in a population as a result of positive selection. As the prevalence of one allele increases, linked alleles can also become more common, whether they are neutral or even slightly deleterious. This is called ''[[genetic hitchhiking]]''. A strong selective sweep results in a region of the genome where the positively selected [[haplotype]] (the allele and its neighbours) are essentially the only ones that exist in the population.

Whether a selective sweep has occurred or not can be investigated by measuring [[linkage disequilibrium]], or whether a given haplotype is overrepresented in the population. Normally, [[genetic recombination]] results in a reshuffling of the different alleles within a haplotype, and none of the haplotypes will dominate the population. However, during a selective sweep, selection for a specific allele will also result in selection of neighbouring alleles. Therefore, the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium might indicate that there has been a 'recent' selective sweep, and this can be used to identify sites recently under selection.

[[Background selection]] is the opposite of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation will tend to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background selection is a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it produces no linkage disequilibrium.

'''''Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest''''' is a book by [[Kim Sterelny]] about the differing views of biologists [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. When first published in [[2001 in literature|2001]] it became an international [[bestseller]], and a new edition was published in [[2007 in literature|2007]] to include Gould's ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]'' finished shortly before his death in 2002, and more recent works by Dawkins.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand-section|date=September 2008}}
===Part I - Battle Joined===
In the introductory chapter the author points out that there have been many conflicts in [[biology]]. Still, few have been as public or as [[polemic]]al as the one between Dawkins and Gould. Dawkins sees [[evolution]] as a [[competition (biology)|competition]] between [[gene]] lineages, where organisms are vehicles for those genes. Gould, a [[paleontology|paleontologist]] mentored by [[George Gaylord Simpson]], has a different perspective. For example, he sees chance as very important, and views [[organism]]s as being more important than genes. Their broader world views also differ, for instance they have very different beliefs about the [[relationship between religion and science]].

===Part II - Dawkins' World===
[[Image:Richard Dawkins 2006.jpg|left|thumb|Richard Dawkins]]
Chapter 2 discusses genes and gene lineages. Dawkins' view on the nature of evolution, as outlined in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has genes as the [[units of selection]], both in the [[origin of life|first replicators]] and in more complex organisms, where alliances of genes are formed (and sometimes broken).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Phenotypic Hierarchy 1.svg|thumb|right|Natural and [[sexual selection]] are often presumed to act most directly on [[behavior]] (e.g., what an animal chooses to do when confronted by a predator), which is expressed within limits set by whole-[[organism]] [[performance]] [[abilities]] (e.g., how fast it can run) that are determined by [[subordinate]] [[traits]] (e.g., muscle fiber-type composition).  A weakness of this [[conceptual]] and [[operational]] model is the absence of an [[explicit]] recognition of the place of [[Life history theory|life history]] traits.]]

'''Evolutionary physiology''' is the study of '''physiological evolution''', which is to say, the manner in which the functional characteristics of individuals in a population of [[organisms]] have responded to selection across multiple [[generations]] during the history of the population.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T., Jr.|coauthors=and P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of both [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary biology]].  Practitioners in this field come from a variety of backgrounds, including [[physiology]], evolutionary biology, [[ecology]] and [[genetics]].  Accordingly, the range of [[phenotypes]] studied by evolutionary physiologists is broad, including but not limited to [[Life history theory|life history]], behavior, whole-organism performance, [[functional morphology]], [[biomechanics]], [[anatomy]], classical physiology, [[endocrinology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[molecular evolution]].  It is closely related to [[comparative physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]], and its findings are a major concern of [[evolutionary medicine]].

== History ==
As the name implies, evolutionary physiology is the product of what was at one time two distinct scientific disciplines.  According to Garland and Carter,&lt;ref name=&quot;GarlandCarter1994&quot;/&gt; evolutionary physiology arose in the late 1970s, following &quot;heated&quot; debates concerning the metabolic and thermoregulatory status of [[dinosaur]]s (see [[physiology of dinosaurs]]) and [[mammal-like reptiles]].  This period was followed by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate [[quantitative genetics]] into [[evolutionary biology]], which had spill-over effects on other fields, such as [[behavioral ecology]] and [[ecophysiology]].  In the mid- to late-1980s, [[phylogenetic comparative methods]] started to became popular in many fields, including [[physiological ecology]] and [[comparative physiology]].  An 1987 volume titled &quot;New Directions in Ecological Physiology&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feder|first=M. E.|coauthors=A. F. Bennett, W. W. Burggren, and R. B. Huey, eds.|authorlink=|title=New directions in ecological physiology|edition=|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=New York|year=1987|isbn=0521349389|pages=364 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; had little ecology but a considerable emphasis on evolutionary topics.  It generated vigorous debate, and within a few years the [[National Science Foundation]] had developed a panel titled [http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/progdesc/1998/bio/ibn/1148.htm  Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology].  Shortly thereafter, selection experiments and [[experimental evolution]] became increasingly common in evolutionary physiology.  Most recently, &quot;macrophysiology&quot; has emerged as a subdiscipline, in which practitioners attempt to identify large-scale patterns in physiological traits (e.g., patterns of covariation with [[latitude]]) and their ecological implications.&lt;ref name='Chownetal2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chown|first=S. L.|coauthors=K. J. Gaston, and D. Robinson|year=2004|title=Macrophysiology: large-scale patterns in physiological traits and their ecological implications| url=|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=18|issue=|pages=159–167|doi=10.1111/j.0269-8463.2004.00825.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent Properties of Evolutionary Physiology ==
As a hybrid scientific discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives.  For example, an understanding of physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or covariation (such as an [[allometric]] relationship) represents what could possibly exist or just what selection has allowed.&lt;ref name=&quot;GarlandCarter1994&quot;/&gt;  Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible for many of the traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]).

==Areas of Research==
Important areas of current research include:
* [[Organismal]] performance as a central [[phenotype]] (e.g., measures of speed or stamina in [[animal locomotion]])
* Role of [[behavior]] in physiological evolution
* Physiological and [[endocrinological]] basis of variation in [[life history]] traits (e.g., [[clutch size]])
* Functional significance of [[molecular evolution]]
* Extent to which species differences are adaptive
* Physiological underpinnings of [[limits]] to [[geographic ranges]]
* Role of [[sexual selection]] in shaping physiological evolution
* Magnitude of &quot;phylogenetic signal&quot; in  physiological traits
* Role of [[pathogens]] and [[parasites]] in physiological evolution and [[immunity]]
* Application of [[optimality modeling]] to elucidate the degree of adaptation 
* Role of [[phenotypic plasticity]] in accounting for species differences
* Mechanistic basis of [[trade-off]]s and [[constraints]] on evolution (e.g., putative [[Carrier's constraint]] on running and breathing) 
* Origin of [[allometric]] scaling relations or [[allometric]] laws (and the so-called [[metabolic theory of ecology]])
* [[Individual variation]] (see also [[Individual differences psychology]])
* Functional significance of biochemical [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]
* Analysis of physiological variation via [[quantitative genetics]]
* Paleophysiology and the evolution of [[endothermy]]
* [[Human]] adaptational [[physiology]]

In addition, the term is used in a broader sense as a world-view covering a wide variety of topics, including chemical evolution as an alternative term for [[abiogenesis]] or for [[nucleosynthesis]] of [[chemical element]]s, [[galaxy formation and evolution]], [[stellar evolution]], [[spiritual evolution]], [[technological evolution]] and [[universal evolution]], which seeks to explain every aspect of the world in which we live.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlEvolutionism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/evolutionism.htm |title=Evolutionism |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2002–2008 |format= |work= |publisher=AllAboutGOD.com, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80949 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[creation-evolution controversy]], creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis &quot;evolutionists&quot; and the theory itself as &quot;evolutionism.&quot; Some [[creationism|creationists]] and creationist organizations, such as the Institute of Creation Research, use these terms in an effort to make it appear that [[evolutionary biology]] is a form of secular religion.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/299/5612/1523 |title=Perceptions in science: Is Evolution a Secular Religion? -- Ruse |author=Michael Ruse |authorlink=Michael Ruse |month=March | year=2003 |work= |publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pages=299 (5612): 1523 |accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=A major complaint of the Creationists, those who are committed to a Genesis-based story of origins, is that evolution--and Darwinism in particular--is more than just a scientific theory.

However, science does not support false religions (e.g. atheism, evolutionism, pantheism, humanism, etc.) |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century usage==
Before the 19th century there were a number of hypotheses regarding the evolution of all material phenomena: suns, moons, planets, earth, life, civilization, and society. The number of hypotheses being propounded increased dramatically in the middle of the 19th century.

The term ''evolution'' was popularised during the 19th century by [[Herbert Spencer]] to mean [[cultural evolution]]; i.e. the increasing [[complexity]] of cultures (see [[Cultural evolution#History of the theory of cultural evolution|History of the theory of cultural evolution]]) &amp;mdash; it was only later that it acquired its [[evolution|biological meaning]].

Anthropologists and biologists refer to &quot;evolutionists&quot; in the 19th century as those who believed that the cultures or life forms being studied are evolving to a ''particular'' form (see [[Platonic form]]). This original theory of evolution was seen as pseudo-science by its contemporaries, similar in standing as [[phrenology]]&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;. Very few scientists today, if any, believe that evolution in culture or biology works that way, and serious discussions generally take caution to distance themselves from that perspective. Evolutionary biology explains biotic changes in terms of internal processes and gradual development as a natural progression of previously existing lifeforms.  Evolution neither denies nor requires a role for [[divine intervention]].

==Modern usage==
In modern times, the term ''[[evolution]]'' is widely used, but the terms ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' are rarely used in scientific circles to refer to the biological discipline. 

The Institute for Creation Science, however, in order to treat evolution as a category of religions, including [[atheism]], [[fascism]], [[humanism]] and [[occultism]], commonly uses the words ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief.&lt;ref name=ICRMuseum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creationwiki.org/Evolutionism |title=Evolutionism - CreationWiki, the encyclopedia of creation science |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of this argument is to establish that the creation-evolution controversy is essentially one of interpretation of evidence, without any overwhelming proof (beyond current scientific theories) on either side. Creationists tend to use the term evolutionism in order to suggest that the theory of evolution and creationism are equal in a philosophical debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toarchive.org/origins/postmonth/jul03.html |title=The Talk.Origins Archive Post of the Month: July 2003 |author=Louann Miller |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms &quot;evolutionism&quot; and &quot;evolutionist&quot; are rarely used in the [[scientific community]] as self-descriptive terms.

==Background==
{{Quotefarm|date=May 2009|section}}
{{Very long section}}
The term can be confusing to those not familiar with it as the terms epic, evolution and myth are usually used in ways different than as applied in the Epic of Evolution.{{Or|date=May 2009}} Evolution generally refers to [[evolution|biological evolution]], but here it means a [[process(science)|process]] in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Polkinghorne, ''The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, ISBN 0802848850 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fy1-hnYDHGIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=One+can+only+speak+of+creation+as+a+process&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1]&lt;/ref&gt; in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form ([[emergence]]). It should not be 'biologized’ as it includes many areas of science&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley - [http://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, ISBN 9004116958&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently than scientists do. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moran – What is Evolution, 1993  [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html]retrieved 4-07-09 &lt;/ref&gt;. The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for [[Evolution as theory and fact]]).

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster [http://www.merriam-webster.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic – Brian Swimme interview [http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:ZUk1tmv3bsYJ:www.earthlight.org/interview26.html+Epic+of+Evolution+Society&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=105&amp;gl=us]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes – provide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell in one of his interview [http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/212-living-dialogues/episodes/2712-michael-dowd-great-story-epic]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epic of Evolution is a systematic story that helps make sense of humanity’s place and purpose in the process that is the Universe. It marries objective scientific facts with the meanings provided by philosophy and the spirituality of religious belief. It is a vast topic and much has been written and debated about it. It offers two different but combined perspectives of the same reality. It tells the tale of the Cosmos in a methodical way but with a religious acceptance of it while addressing complexity, directionality, purpose, human psychology and survival of the most cooperative and compassionate beings. This epic tale helps some people to deepen their faith and to understand and appreciate other religions and philosophies. They may move from believing in God, to knowing God. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epicofevolution.com/celebrate.html Celebrating the Epic of Evolution]retrieved 4/15/09&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word &quot;[[myth]]&quot; in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines &quot;a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society.&quot; He suggests that the Greek term &quot;[[mythos]]&quot; would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this Epic of Evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?[http://www.science-spirit.org/printerfriendly.php?article_id=29]- retrieved 3-22-09&lt;/ref&gt; Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple nor easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world’s spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.&lt;ref&gt; William Grassie, Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) - page 6 of this ref- [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Science and Spirit]retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on the term and it has been used in a number of texts. These authors however at times have substituted synonyms such as: Evolutionary Epic ([[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson)]]), Universal Story ([[Brian Swimme]], [[John F. Haught]]), Great Story (Connie Barlow, [[Michael Dowd]]), Everybody’s Story ([[Loyal Rue]]), New Story ([[Thomas Berry]], [[Al Gore]]), Cosmic Evolution ([[Eric Chaisson]]) and epic of creation ([[Philip Hefner]])&lt;ref&gt;*Edward O.

[[Image:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|130px|left|E.O.Wilson]]
‘Epic of evolution’ is a term that, within the past three years, has become the theme and title of a number of gatherings. It seems to have been first used by Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1978&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson coined the term ‘evolutionary epic’– Teilhard Perspective, Volume 30 #2 Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;‘The evolutionary epic,’. Wilson wrote in his book On Human Nature, ‘is probably the best myth we will ever have.’ Myth as falsehood was not the usage intended by Wilson in this statement. Rather, myth as a grand narrative that provides a people with a placement in time—a meaningful placement that celebrates extraordinary moments of a shared heritage. The epic of evolution is science translated into meaningful story”.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Barlow - ''The Epic of Evolution: Religious and cultural interpretations of modern scientific cosmology''[http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 Science &amp; Spirit Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was not the first to use the term but his fame, he is a two-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction, prompted its usage as the morphed phrase epic of evolution. In later years he also used the newer term Epic of Evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Novacek | first = Michael J. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001 | url =http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html| title =Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson | format = | work = | publisher =CNN.com | accessdate =2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wilson explained that humans had a need for the Epic of Evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'' By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,ISBN 0791443922,&lt;/ref&gt;. He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way&lt;ref&gt; Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998 [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a  religious way if they elect to do so.&lt;ref&gt; Ursula Goodenough - Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), ISBN 0195136292&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Phil Hefner 1997.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Philip Hefner]]
Dr. [[Philip Hefner]] is the former editor for ''[[Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science]]'', the leading journal{{Fact|date=May 2009}} of religion and science in the world. He uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common. “We are here to weave the spiritualities that are life-giving for our phase of the Epic of Evolution and for the next generation.” &lt;ref&gt;Classic Quotations - Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. Audrey R. Chapman says of him – Philip Hefner is perhaps the theologian who has grappled the most seriously and explicitly with the evolution of human nature. His approach to this topic, particularly in his work ‘The Human Factor’ is to sacralize the process of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey R. Chapman - Unprecedented Choices: Religious Ethics at the Frontiers of Genetic Science, Fortress Press, 1999, ISBN 0800631811&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy.  It is not  science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domaine of religion-and-science&lt;ref&gt;Hefner - The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;. The evolutionary epic is not science; it is scientifically informed myth. We must be clear about this (…)When Wilson wrote that “the true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic,” he also understood and proposed that the epic be incorporated into mythic religious formulation (1978, 206–7). &lt;ref&gt; Zygon Editorial [http://www.zygonjournal.org/editorial_latest.html]retrieved 3-13-09&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:UrsulaG.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Goodenough]]
Biologist Dr. [[Ursula Goodenough]] makes frequent use of the term and uses it to extrapolate from the concept of evolution to a guiding belief for mankind. She writes in  Sacred Depths (Emerging Religious Beliefs) &quot;When the responses elicited by the Epic of Evolution are gathered together several religious principles emerge that I can believe, serve as a framework for a global Ethos&quot;. She makes use of  Hefner’s weaving metaphor to title the Epic of Evolution the warp on which the welt, pattern, color and art of humanity is woven.  It is the story that beautifully anchors human nature and purpose to the planetary picture. Religious naturalism is a response to this tale that provides a deep and abiding spiritual awareness and morality&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough - ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'', Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, ISBN 0195126130&lt;/ref&gt;. For more comments on the Epic see [[Wikiquote:Ursula Goodenough|Goodenought quotes]]

Evolutionary evangelist and  Pentecostal minister [[Michael Dowd]] uses the term to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology ([[theistic evolution]]). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of [[Religious Naturalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128 Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd is the author of ''Thank God for Evolution: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dowd  -   ''Thank God for Evolution: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World'' - Viking Adult (June 19, 2008), ISBN 0670020451&lt;/ref&gt;. He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/book Thank God for Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd’s stance is similar to that of the position of the Catholic Church. A Vatican official has reaffirmed that evolution is not incompatible with faith &lt;ref&gt; Herald Tribune - Europe,  2008/09/16[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/16/europe/EU-Vatican-Evolution.php]retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;. Reuters on Sept 16, 2008 reported that the Church considered the theory of evolution compatible with the Bible and saw no reason why God may not have used such a natural process in creating mankind. The Catholic Church teaches ‘theistic evolution’ which accepts evolution as a valid scientific theory. &lt;ref&gt; VATICAN CITY (Reuters)[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSLG62672220080916] retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:LoyalRue.jpg|thumb|105 px |left|Loyal Rue]]
Dr.[[Loyal Rue]], recipient of two [[John Templeton Foundation]] fellowships, describes the Epic as “the biggest of all pictures”, “the ultimate account of how things are”, “the sprawling narrative of evolutionary events”, “the essential foundation for discussions about which things matter”, “the unfolding drama” and &quot;humbles us before the magnitude and complexity of creation”. In his Epilogue to ''Everybody's Story'', he explains that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it&lt;ref&gt; Loyal Rue - Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, ISBN 0791443922&lt;/ref&gt;.
Rue has a whole section on the Epic in his 2006 book ''Religion is not About God''. He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things - we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness- maximinized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.&lt;ref&gt; Loyal Rue - ''Religion is not About God'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, ISBN 0813539552&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Brian swimme.jpg|thumb|100 px |right|Swimme,PhD]]

Dr. [[Brian Swimme]], mathematical cosmologist  and author of several books dealing with cosmology, evolution and religion, sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe. It is an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman’s thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is ‘definitely mythic' – it has the fundamental nature of being mythic.“You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans.”&lt;ref&gt; Center for the Story of the Universe [http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

He concludes in a 1997 interview ''Science as Wisdom: The New Story as a Way Forward'' &lt;ref&gt;Brian Swimme interview - Science as Wisdom: 
The New Story as a Way Forward [http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:ZUk1tmv3bsYJ:www.earthlight.org/interview26.html+Epic+of+Evolution+Society&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=105&amp;gl=us]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote| I think that what E. O. Wilson is trying to suggest is that to be fully human, a person has to see that life has a heroic dimension (…) I think for the scientist, and for other people, it's a question of &quot;is the universe valuable? Is it sacred? Is it holy? Or is the human agenda all that matters?&quot; I just don't think we're that stupid to continue in a way that continues to destroy. I'm hopeful that the Epic of Evolution will be yet another strategy in our culture that will lead our consciousness out of a very tight, human-centered materialism. |10px|10px| - EarthLight Magazine 1997 – interview by Lauren de Boer}} 
[[Image:Gordon Kaufman.gif|thumb|110px|left|Gordon Kaufman]]
Dr. [[Gordon D. Kaufman]], Professor of Divinity (Emeritus) at Harvard University and a past president of the [[American Academy of Religion]], in a more theistic manner sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process referring to it as a relative new ‘common creation story'. He states - It is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward) as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing, coming into being, of new modes of reality&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman  -  ''God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world'', Fortress Press, 1996, page 101-2, ISBN 0800629590 [http://books.google.com/books?id=uYKDqTUfshQC] retrieved 3-17-09&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his book, ''In the beginning—creativity'', he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution – a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences &lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman - ''In the beginning—creativity'', Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, ISBN 0800660935 [http://books.google.com/books?id=4wMcBvErCX0C]retrieved 3-17-09]&lt;/ref&gt;. It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue. &lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1634 evolutionary evangelist] retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner in the March 2009 edition of Zygon says the Epic of Evolution is the natural history story of the universe that zooms from a cosmic macro-story to the micro-story  life on the Earth&lt;ref&gt;Hefner - The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a process over billions of years in which entities change into different and usually more complex forms. The Epic is not a narrative poem but a series of happenings that form the proper subject for a kind of heroic story. It is a story with chapters that may cover decades, thousands, millions  or billions of years. It can run from a few chapters to a great many depending on how one wishes to sub-divide it. Due to the time frames involved, a [[Logarithmic timeline]] has some advantages over straight line ones.

{{cquote|Without a brainy seat of consciousness, galaxies would twirl and stars would shine, but no one would know it. Nothing could likely comprehend the majesty of the reality that is Nature. By contrast, with a conscious, curious brain, we probe the past and discovery our history, striving to decipher our celestial roots and the routes that brought us to the here and now, all the while searching for a better understanding of both the cosmos and ourselves.

Dr. [[Eric Chaisson]], an American astrophysicist and science educator best known for his research, teaching and writing on the interdisciplinary science of cosmic evolution , sees a directionality to the Epic. He writes – From galaxies to snowflakes, from stars to planets to life itself, we are beginning to identify an underlying pattern penetrating the fabric of all the natural sciences- a sweeping encompassing view along the  ‘arrow of time'&lt;ref&gt;Eric Chaisson  - ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006 page xii, ISBN 0231135602&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_future.html Arrow of Time]&lt;/ref&gt;. Author [[Robert Wright]] in ''[[Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny]]'' also agrees that the biological epic and human history have a direction, destiny or purpose. He uses [[game theory]] ([[zero-sum]] and [[non-zero sum]] games) to prove his point. 
&lt;ref&gt; Robert Wright – ''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny'', Vintage Press, 2001, pages 7, 334, ISBN-0-679-75894-1&lt;/ref&gt;. These views point to ongoing and future chapters to the Epic of Evolution.

Professor David Christian, San Diego State University, organizes the epic of creation into eight thresholds. Each threshold marks a time when something truly new appeared and forms never before seen began to arise. The story Christian relates has only been possible since the mid-1900 due to improved dating techniques. As he explains, this epic will continue to grow and change as scientists and historians accumulate new knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity, Course No. 8050  [http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=8050]retrieved 4-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Out of into deep space.png|thumb|150px|left|Future Chapter – Ways to Make Contact in Deep Space]]
Evolution of life on Earth is a fact substantiated by thousands of scientists. There is plenty of confirming evidence in the geological and biological records. &quot;The word 'theory' does not belong in front of the word 'evolution'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/ Is Evolution a Fact?]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; The more proper term should be continuing ‘Epic’ rather than finalized ‘theory’. It is not a final tale but an on going saga. The scenario of cosmic evolution is a human invention. It’s a long and spectacular story, an evolutionary epic that includes the storyteller. Despite its 7 major epochs, this grand narrative was not handed to us on a stone tablet atop some mountain. The scientific community has gradually deciphered the story, is now telling it forthrightly, and continues to refine it as we learn more &lt;ref&gt;Tufts University - A Continuing Story [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_site_summary.html]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Epic, after all, is a dynamic story not a static once-and-for-all narrative myth (Philip Hefner). [[Wright Center for Science Education]] at [[Tufts University]] in its Cosmic Evolution story (Epoch 8 – Future Evolution, Prospects for Human Survival and Alien Life) attempts to spell out what the future chapters may be (The future is a tricky subject. To comment on it is to run the risk of saying nothing concrete. The future is especially troublesome to foresee when life is involved […] Claiming knowledge of the pathways along which cosmic evolution will proceed henceforth is akin to dabbling in science fiction. Nonetheless, it’s possible to examine certain boundary conditions that will likely influence, many of them adversely so, the future of life on Earth) &lt;ref&gt;Future Chapters [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_future.html  ]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:Rodin TheThinker.jpg|thumb|120px| right|Question - &lt;p&gt;Are We Smart Enough ?]]

Humankind may have evolved in the past from universal matter, but our future is now largely in our own hands. Are we smart enough to adjust to this alteration in the evolutionary scenario? Are we wise enough to ensure our own survival? The destiny of human life on Earth will truly be a measure of our current intelligence. And how we write these future chapters.

John Stewart author of ''Evolution's Arrow: The Direction of Evolution and the Future of Humanity'' writes: A completely new phase in the evolution of life on Earth has begun. It will change everything. In this new phase evolution will be driven intentionally, by humanity. The evolutionary worldview that emerges from an understanding of our role in the new phase has the potential to transform the nature of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;INTENTIONAL EVOLUTION [http://www.evolutionarymanifesto.com/man.html]retrieved3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart summarizes the future arrow of evolution into four main areas:
*Intentional evolution
*Advancing evolution by organizing a cooperative global society
*Advancing evolution by enhancing evolvability
*The unique capacity of the evolutionary worldview to provide direction and purpose for humanity

==Creation-evolution controversy==

In that the Epic of Evolution is the full comprehensive story of evolution, it is subject to the same if not more debates than have characterized the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hovind|2006}}, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of the Universe, life and humanity  between the proponents of evolution, backed by [[scientific consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;Martz &amp; McDaniel 1987, p. 23, Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science&lt;/ref&gt; and those who propose literal interpretations of ancient texts by [[Fundamentalist|religious fundamentalists]].{{Failed verification|date=May 2009}} This clash goes beyond the field of [[evolutionary biology]] and  includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the [[evidence of evolution]] is overwhelming, and the consensus supporting the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] is nearly absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm | last = Delgado | first = Cynthia | title = Finding evolution in medicine | journal = NIH Record | volume = 58 | issue = 15 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 | language = english | format = hmtl }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dover_pg83&quot;&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:
{{cquote|Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.|10px|10px| - ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism'', National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref&gt;

Dr.[[John Haught]],  Roman Catholic theologian, in his ''Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation'' suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being chanced by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy.&lt;ref&gt; John F. Haught - ''Science and Religion: from conflict to conversation'', Paulist Press, 1995, page 69, ISBN 0809136066 [http://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC]&lt;/ref&gt; There are liberal congregations these days that may see the Epic of Evolution as a history about life and the Universe that is both scientific and sacred. The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence, giving Nature an inspiring beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'' - A sermon by Douglas Taylor [http://uubinghamton.org/sermons/17sep2006.html]retrieved 3-15-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Chaisson in his book, ''Epic of Evolution'', concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolution – a powerful and noble effort – may perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium

Not all of the Epic’s advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a ‘narrative of mythic proportions’ that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists that dispute this contending that this is a [[materialistic]] story of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley - [http://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm.

==Educational efforts==

Besides the many books, journals, and videos on the evolution epic that have been published in recent years, there have been numerous other educational efforts and teaching aids developed to promote awareness of it.&lt;ref&gt;Books, Journals and Videos on the Epic of Evolution [http://www.epicofevolution.org/resources.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]] held a conference on the Epic of Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iras.org/Past%20Conferences.html Past Conferences], [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] organized a conference on the Epic of Evolution as part of their program on Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Conferences/CF_1997_11_1214_epic.shtml American Association for the Advancement of Science - Epic of Evolution conference program]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, The Forum on Religion and Ecology with special support from the Center for Respect of Life and Environment sponsored a conference titled The Epic of Evolution and World Religions.

      <comment>/* Orgel's First Rule */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{context}}
'''Orgel's rules''' are a set of axioms attributed to the [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Leslie Orgel]].

==Orgel's First Rule==
&quot;Whenever a [[spontaneous process]] is too slow or too inefficient a [[protein]] will evolve to speed it up or make it more efficient.&quot;

This &quot;rule&quot; comments on the fact that there is a great number of proteins in all organisms which fulfil a number of different functions through modifying chemical or physical processes. An example would be an [[enzyme]] that [[Catalysis|catalyses]] a [[chemical reaction]] that would take place too slow to benefit an organism without being sped up by this enzyme.

==Orgel's Second Rule==
&quot;[[Evolution]] is cleverer than you are.&quot;

Orgel's Second Rule is intended as a rejoinder to the [[argument by lack of imagination]].
In general, this rule expresses the sometimes experienced fact that &quot;trial and error&quot; strategies are better than centralized intelligent human planning.

Orgel's rule can also be used to counter creationist arguments in which often the hidden and non-provable presumption is suggested, that human intelligent planning is in general superior to trial and error strategies used by evolution.

The same principle has been given as an analogy to [[software]] developed in an evolutionary sense by group collaboration, as opposed to software built to a pre-ordained design that was created without reference to previous implementation.  Although, the development is not claimed to be of the same random nature as is by evolutionary genetics.

'''Objections to evolution''' have been raised ever since various [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary ideas]] came to prominence around the start of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=icj&gt;{{cite web  | last = Johnston  | first =Ian C.  | title =Section Three: The Origins of Evolutionary Theory  | work =. . .

In the 1930s and 1940s scientists produced the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], which combined Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] with [[population genetics]].&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;{{cite web  | last =van Wyhe  | first = John  | title =Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist: A biographical sketch  | work = The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online  | publisher =University of Cambridge  | date = 2002-7  | url =http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this period, the existence of evolutionary processes, and the ability of the modern evolutionary synthesis to explain how and why these processes occur, have been uncontroversial among biologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf ''IAP STATEMENT ON THE TEACHING OF EVOLUTION''], Interacademy Panel&lt;/ref&gt;

After the production of the modern synthesis, nearly all criticisms of evolution have come from [[religion|religious]] sources, rather than the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;In his comprehensive treatise on Creationism, ''The Creationists'', historian [[Ronald Numbers]] traces the religious motivations and scientific pretensions, of prominent creationists from [[George Frederick Wright]] through [[George McCready Price]], [[Harry Rimmer]], [[John C. Whitcomb]], [[Henry M. Morris]] and his [[Institute for Creation Research]] (and many lesser figures) to [[Phillip E. Johnson‎]] and the [[Intelligent design movement]].&lt;br&gt;
{{cite book  | last = Numbers  | first = Ronald  | authorlink = Ronald Numbers  | title = The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, Expanded Edition  | publisher = Harvard University Press  |date=[[November 30]], [[2006]]  | isbn = 0674023390  | page = 624 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many [[Christianity|Christians]] who believe in God as the Creator do not see evolution as a threat to their beliefs thus accepting the theory and process. Among these [[theistic evolution]]ists are many respected theologians who claim to have gained theological insights from evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, Laurie R. ''Scientists Confront Creationism''. Pg 8. W. W. Norton &amp; Company (1984). ISBN 0393301540.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Christians rejected evolution from its outset as &quot;heresy&quot;, but most attempted to reconcile scientific evolution with Biblical accounts of creation.&lt;ref&gt;D'Souza, Dinesh. ''What's So Great about Christianity''. Pg 144. Regnery Publishing (2007). ISBN 1596985178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] accepts the natural evolution of plants and animals, but the origin of man is contested and no consensus has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Emerick, Yahiya. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam''. Pg 81. Alpha Books (2001). ISBN 0028642333.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to earlier objections to evolution that were either strictly scientific or explicitly religious, some recent objections to evolution have attempted to blur this distinction. In particular, American movements such as [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]] attack the [[naturalism (philosophy)|empirical basis]] of science and argue that there is greater scientific evidence for the design of life by an unspecified intelligent being, or the biblical account of creation. Many of the arguments against evolution include objections to the [[evidence for evolution]], as well as the  methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance of [[evolutionary biology]]. The scientific community, however, does not accept such objections as having any validity, citing misunderstandings in the concept of a scientific theory, the overwhelming scientific consensus on the evidence for evolution, and detractors' misinterpretations of basic physical laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|format=PDF|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining evolution==
{{further|[[Evolution (term)]]}}

One of the main sources of confusion and ambiguity in the creation-evolution debate is the definition of ''evolution'' itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. However, the word has a number of different meanings in different fields, from [[evolutionary computation]] to [[chemical evolution]] to [[sociocultural evolution]] to [[stellar evolution|stellar]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]]. It can even refer to [[evolution (philosophy)|metaphysical evolution]], [[higher evolution|spiritual evolution]], or any of a number of [[evolutionism|evolutionist]] philosophies. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about [[abiogenesis]] or the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran|first=Laurence|year=1993|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html|title=What is Evolution?|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial contexts, ''evolution'' can refer to any sort of progressive development, and often bears a connotation of gradual improvement: here evolution is understood as a process that results in greater quality or complexity. This common definition, when misapplied to biological evolution, leads to frequent misunderstandings. For example, the idea of [[Devolution (biological fallacy)|devolution]] (&quot;backwards&quot; evolution) is a result of erroneously assuming that evolution is directional or has a specific goal in mind (cf. [[orthogenesis]]). In reality, the evolution of an organism has no &quot;objective&quot; other than increasing the organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment; and its suitability is only defined in relation to this environment. Biologists do not consider any one species, such as humans, to be more &quot;highly evolved&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; than another. Humans are led to believe otherwise by our tendency to evaluate nonhuman organisms according to our own, [[anthropocentric]] standards, rather than more objective ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;devolving&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciam.com/askexpert_question.cfm?articleID=00071863-683B-1C72-9EB7809EC588F2D7|publisher=Scientific American|title=Ask the experts:Biology-Is the human race evolving or devolving?|year=1998|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor does evolution require that organisms become more complex. Although the [[timeline of evolution|history of life]] shows an apparent trend towards the [[evolution of complexity]], some have questioned if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if this conclusion comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on earth has always consisted of [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102&amp;ndash;9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution; rather, it is a consequence of the specific circumstances of evolution on Earth, which frequently made greater complexity advantageous, and thus [[natural selection|naturally selected]] for. Indeed, depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;devolving&quot;/&gt;

Creationist sources frequently define evolution according to its colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution are actually [[straw man|straw men]] that do not address the findings of evolutionary biology. This also means that advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;moran&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doolan|first=Robert|year=1996|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v18/i3/wisdom_teeth.asp|title=Oh! My aching wisdom teeth!|publisher=[http://www.answersingenesis.org Answers in Genesis]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of objections==
{{further|[[History of evolutionary thought]], [[History of creationism]] and [[Creation-evolution controversy]]}}
[[Image:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|frame|left|Even as it gained increasing scientific acceptance, [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution met strong religious resistance.]]

The earliest objections to Darwinian evolution were both scientific and religious. Many of Darwin's contemporaries eventually came to accept the [[transmutation of species]] based upon [[fossil]] evidence; forming the [[X Club]] to defend it against the church and wealthy amateurs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/November.html AboutDarwin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although the specific evolutionary mechanism which Darwin provided{{ndash}} [[natural selection]]{{ndash}} was actively disputed by alternative theories such as [[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]]. Darwin's [[gradualism|gradualistic]] account was also opposed by [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]] and [[catastrophism]]. Additionally, the specific [[hereditary]] mechanism Darwin provided, [[pangenesis]], lacked any supporting evidence. In the early 20th century, pangenesis was replaced by [[Mendelian inheritance]], leading to the rise of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. The modern synthesis rose to universal acceptance among biologists with the help of new evidence, such as [[genetics]], which confirmed Darwin's predictions and refuted the competing theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=PJ|last=Bowler|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|year=2003|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea, Third Edition, Completely Revised and Expanded|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520236936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then continuing active research has brought new ideas, such as [[punctuated equilibrium]] and continued disagreements on the importance various observed mechanisms such as [[genetic drift]], but evolutionary theory itself has been entirely uncontested in the field of biology and is commonly described as the &quot;cornerstone of modern biology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=William Overton (judge)|last=Overton|first=William|year=1982|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html|title=McLean v.

Many early religious objections to Darwin's theory, in contrast, are used in modern opposition to evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share [[common descent|common ancestors]] seemed to contradict the [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis account of Creation]]. Believers in [[Biblical infallibility]] attacked Darwinism as heretical. The [[natural theology]] of the early 19th century was typified by [[William Paley|Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]], an [[teleological argument|argument from design]] still used by the creationist movement.

Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of [[theistic evolution]] were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans.&lt;ref name=Darwin&amp;design&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/ |title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Darwin and design: historical essay |accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been adopted by many denominations of [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Christianity]] and [[Jewish views on evolution|Judaism]] that have gone from ignoring evolution to explicitly stating evolution and religion are not in conflict. This is accomplished by [[Liberal Christianity|Modernist theology]] which tends to view the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]] as allegorical and as a product of human history. However, in the 1920s [[fundamentalist Christianity|Christian fundamentalists]] in the [[United States]] developed their literalist arguments against Modernist theology into opposition to the teaching of evolution due to fears that ‘‘[[Darwinism]]’’ had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the [[creation-evolution controversy]] involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting to the teaching of evolution in public schools. Although early objections dismissed evolution for contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was invalidated when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref name=SM07&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

Since then creationists have developed more nuanced objections to evolution, alleging variously that it is unscientific, infringes on creationists' [[freedom of religion|religious freedoms]], that the acceptance of the modern evolutionary synthesis is a religious stance, or that belief in God is scientific. Creationists have appealed to democratic principles of fairness, arguing that evolution is controversial, and that science classrooms should therefore &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot;. These objections to evolution culminated in the [[intelligent design movement]] in the 1990s that had public support in the United States, as it [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|unsuccessfully]] attempted to present itself as a scientific alternative to evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;HarrisPoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harrisdealerpoll.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |title=The Harris Poll - Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God |format= |work=Harris Interactive |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bush&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.nsta.org/pressroom&amp;news_story_ID=50794|title=National Science Teachers Association Disappointed About Intelligent Design Comments Made by President Bush|publisher=[http://www.nsta.org/ National Science Teachers Association Press]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to evolution's scientific acceptance==
Many recent objections to evolutionary theory have focused on downplaying its scientific acceptance, attempting to discredit or invalidate it in order to advocate creationism as an equally good, or superior, explanation for life's diversity. Creationists often argue, for example, that evolution is unproven, non-factual, or controversial.

===Evolution is just a theory, not a fact===
{{further|[[Evolution as theory and fact]]}}

Critics of evolution frequently assert that evolution is &quot;just a theory&quot;, with the intent of emphasizing evolution's unproven nature, or of characterizing it as a matter of opinion rather than of fact or evidence. This reflects a misunderstanding of the meaning of ''[[theory]]'' in a scientific context: whereas in colloquial speech a theory is a conjecture or guess, in science a theory is simply an explanation or model of the world that makes testable predictions. When ''evolution'' is used to describe a theory, it refers to an explanation for the diversity of species and their ancestry. An example of evolution as theory is the [[modern evolutionary synthesis|modern synthesis]] of Darwinian [[natural selection]] and [[Mendelian inheritance]]. As with any scientific theory, the modern synthesis is constantly debated, tested, and refined by scientists. There is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that it remains the only robust model that accounts for the known facts concerning evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;moran2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran|first=Laurence|year=1993|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html|title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also state that evolution is not a [[fact]]. In science, a fact is a verified empirical observation; in colloquial contexts, however, a fact can simply refer to anything for which there is overwhelming evidence. For example, in common usage theories such as &quot;the Earth revolves around the Sun&quot; and &quot;objects fall due to gravity&quot; may be referred to as &quot;facts&quot;, even though they are purely theoretical. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, evolution may be called a &quot;fact&quot; for the same reason that gravity can: under the scientific definition, evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time. Under the colloquial definition, the theory of evolution can also be called a fact, referring to this theory's well-established nature. Thus, evolution is widely considered [[evolution as theory and fact|both a theory and a fact]] by scientists.&lt;ref name=Isaak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-misconceptions.html|title=Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution|first=Mark|last=Isaak|year=2003|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite book|title=Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes|first=SJ|last=Gould|publisher=W.

Similar confusion is involved in objections that evolution is &quot;unproven&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=HM|year=1985|title=Scientific Creationism|publisher=Master Books|isbn=978-0890510025}}&lt;/ref&gt; strict [[proof theory|proof]] is possible only in [[formal science]]s such as logic and mathematics, not [[natural science]]s (where the proper term is &quot;validated&quot;), so this is trivially true, and no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a &quot;theory&quot; is. The confusion arises, however, in that the colloquial meaning of ''proof'' is simply &quot;compelling evidence&quot;, in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution &quot;proven&quot;. The distinction is an important one in [[philosophy of science]], as it relates to the lack of absolute [[certainty]] in all empirical claims, not just evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theobald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Theobald|first=Douglas|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/sciproof.html|title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: Scientific &quot;Proof&quot;, scientific evidence, and the scientific method|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution is controversial or contested===

{{further|[[Level of support for evolution]]}}

One of the most recent major objections to evolution is in a sense [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling]]: it argues that evolution is controversial or contentious. Unlike past creationist arguments which sought to abolish the teaching of evolution altogether, this argument makes the weaker claim that evolution, being controversial, should be presented alongside other, alternative views, and students should be allowed to evaluate and choose between the options on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Stephen C. Meyer|last=Meyer|first=SC|year=2002|url=http://www.arn.org/docs/meyer/sm_teachthecontroversy.htm|title=Teach the controversy|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal to &quot;fairness&quot; and a more democratic, &quot;balanced&quot; approach in which conflicting views are given &quot;equal time&quot; appeals to many American creationists, and had been endorsed by former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;equal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA040.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA040: Equal time|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This objection forms the basis of the &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot; campaign, an attempt by the [[Discovery Institute]] to promote the teaching of [[intelligent design]] in public schools. This in turn forms a major part of the Institute's &quot;[[wedge strategy]]&quot;, an attempt to gradually undermine evolution and ultimately to &quot;reverse the stifling [[materialism|materialist]] world view and replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A copy of the Discovery Institutes ''Wedge Strategy'' document can be found here:  {{cite web|url=http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wedge Strategy|publisher=Discovery Institute|year=1999|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and U.S. courts have rejected this objection on the grounds that science is not based on [[appeal to popularity|appeals to popularity]], but on evidence. The [[scientific consensus]] of biologists, not popular opinion or &quot;fairness&quot;, determines what is considered acceptable science, and it is argued that although evolution is clearly controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;

In response, creationists have disputed the level of scientific [[support for evolution]]. The Discovery Institute has gathered over 600 scientists since 2001 to sign &quot;[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]&quot; in order to show that there are a number of scientists who dispute what they refer to as &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot;. This statement did not profess outright disbelief in evolution, but expressed skepticism as to the ability of &quot;random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life.&quot; Several counter-petitions have been launched in turn, including [[A Scientific Support for Darwinism]], which gathered over 7,000 signatures in four days, and [[Project Steve]], a tongue-in-cheek petition that has gathered 1072 (as of March 13th, 2009) evolution-supporting scientists named &quot;Steve&quot;.

Creationists have argued for over a century that evolution is &quot;[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis|a theory in crisis]]&quot; that will soon be overturned. This is based on a variety of objections to evolution, including that it [[#Evolution's evidence is unreliable or inconsistent|lacks reliable evidence]] or [[#Evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics|violates natural laws]]. These objections have been rejected by most scientists, as have claims that intelligent design, or any other creationist explanation, meets the basic scientific standards that would be required to make them scientific &quot;alternatives&quot; to evolution. It is also argued that even if evidence against evolution exists, it is a [[false dilemma]] to characterize this as evidence ''for'' intelligent design.&lt;ref name=&quot;equal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=GR|year=2002|url=http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm|title=The Imminent Demise of Evolution: The Longest Running Falsehood in Creationism|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar objection to evolution is that certain scientific authorities{{ndash}} mainly pre-modern ones{{ndash}} have doubted or rejected evolution. Most commonly, it is argued that Darwin &quot;recanted&quot; on his deathbed, a myth originating from the [[Elizabeth Hope|Lady Hope Story]]. These objections are generally rejected as [[appeal to authority|appeals to authority]]. Even if this myth were true, it would hold no bearing on the merit of the theory itself.

==Objections to evolution's scientific status==
A common [[neo-creationist]] objection to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards&amp;mdash;that it is not genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the [[scientific method]], and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the very nature of evolutionary theory and the scientific method.

===Evolution is a religion===
{{further|[[Relationship between religion and science]]}}

Creationists commonly argue against evolution on the grounds that &quot;evolution is a religion; it is not a science&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Ken Ham|last=Ham|first=K|year=1987|title=The Lie: Evolution|url=http://www.creationists.org/evolutionisreligion.html|publisher=Master Books|isbn=0-89051-158-6|accessdate=2007-03-24}} See Evolution is Religion, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this criticism is to undermine the &quot;higher ground&quot; biologists claim in debating creationists, and to reframe the debate from being between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to being between two equally religious beliefs&amp;mdash;or, in some cases, even to argue that evolution is religious, while some form of creationism (typically [[intelligent design]]) is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=William Dembski|last=Dembski|first=WA|year=2006|title=The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities (Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction and Decision Theory)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521678674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;notscience&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=HM|year=2001|url=http://www.icr.org/pdf/imp/imp-332.pdf|format=PDF|title=Evolution Is Religion&amp;mdash;Not Science|journal=Impact:  Vital Articles on Science/Creation|volume=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that oppose evolution frequently refer to supporters of evolution as &quot;[[Evolutionism|Evolutionists]]&quot; or &quot;[[Darwinism|Darwinists]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ham&quot;/&gt;

The arguments for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by [[analogy]]: it is argued that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on [[faith]], that supporters of evolution revere Darwin as a prophet, and that supporters of evolution [[dogma]]tically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiker|first=BD|year=2003|url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/julaug2003/feature1.htm|title=Does Science Point to God? Part II: The Christian Critics|publisher=[http://www.crisismagazine.com/ Crisis Magazine]|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neocreationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Eugenie Scott|last=Scott|first=EC|year=2004|title=Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520246500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, supporters of evolution have argued that no scientist's claims, including Darwin's, are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years, to form first [[Neo-Darwinism]] and later the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaak, Mark (2004). &quot;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA611.html Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA611: Evolution Sacrosanct?]&quot;. [[TalkOrigins Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kutschera U, Niklas KJ |title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=255–76 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15241603 |doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that evolution relies on faith, often based on the idea that [[#Evolution has never been observed|evolution has never been observed]], is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.

In general, the argument that evolution is religious has been rejected on the grounds that ''[[religion]]'' is not defined by how dogmatic, closed-minded, or zealous its adherents are, but by its spiritual or supernatural beliefs. In addition to disputing the idea that evolution is dogmatic or based on faith, thus, supporters of evolution accuse creationists of [[equivocation|equivocating]] between the strict definition of ''religion'' and its colloquial usage to refer to anything that is enthusiastically or dogmatically engaged in. U.S. courts have also rejected this objection:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=McLean v Arkansas Board of Education|vol=529|reporter=F.Supp.|opinion=1255|court=US District Court|year=1982|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A related claim is that [[#Evolution leads to atheism|evolution is atheistic]]; creationists sometimes merge the two claims and describe evolution as an &quot;atheistic religion&quot; (cf. [[humanism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;notscience&quot;/&gt; This argument against evolution is also frequently generalized into a criticism of all science; it is argued that &quot;science is an atheistic religion&quot;, on the grounds that its [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] is as unproven, and thus as &quot;faith-based&quot;, as the [[supernatural]] and theistic beliefs of creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cline|first=A|year=2006|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismscienceevolution/a/ScienceFaith.htm|title=Myth: Science is a Religion for Atheists that Requires Faith|publisher=about.com|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution is unfalsifiable===
A statement is considered [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] if there is an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the statement is false. Evolution is considered falsifiable because it makes many predictions that, if they were contradicted by the evidence, would falsify evolution. In contrast, many religious beliefs are not falsifiable, because no testable prediction has been made about the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=JS|year=1997|title=Evolution and Philosophy:Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean?|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many creationists (for example [[Henry M. Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Creationism'', [[Henry M. Morris]], 1974 Master Books, [[Arkansas]], pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;) have claimed that evolution is unfalsifiable.
They claim that any fact can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, and that therefore it is impossible to demonstrate evolution is wrong. Actually, many kinds of evidence could falsify evolution, such as the fossil record showing no change over time, confirmation that mutations are prevented from accumulating, or observations showing organisms being created supernaturally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA211.html ''TalkOrigins Claim CA211''], Mark Isaak, editor, Index to Creationist Claims, [[TalkOrigins]], 2006. Retrieved on [[2008-04-20]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others claim that past events of speciation are not observable and repeatable, and therefore evolution is not falsifiable. In 1976, philosopher Karl Popper said that &quot;Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=K|year=1985|title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0087583436}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Popper later recanted and offered a more nuanced view of its status:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, Darwin's own most important contribution to the theory of evolution, his theory of natural selection, is difficult to test. There are some tests, even some experimental tests; and in some cases, such as the famous phenomenon known as 'industrial [[melanism]]', we can observe natural selection happening under our very eyes, as it were. Nevertheless, really severe tests of the theory of natural selection are hard to come by, much more so than tests of otherwise comparable theories in physics or chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;popper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Popper|first=K|year=1978|title=Natural selection and the emergence of mind|journal=Dialectica|issue=32|doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1978.tb01321.x|volume=32|pages=339|pages339=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/cej/2/4/misquoted-scientists-respond Misquoted Scientists Respond] [[National Center for Science Education]] 1981 by John R. Cole quoting Popper:  &quot;I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The most direct evidence that evolutionary theory is falsifiable may be the original words of Charles Darwin who, in chapter 6 of &quot;On the Origin of Species...&quot;, wrote this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life|first=Charles|last=Darwin|year=1859|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the unfalsifiability criticism of evolutionary theory, numerous examples of potential ways to falsify evolution have been proposed.  [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied &quot;[[Precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution, Third Edition|first=M|last=Ridley|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited|year=2003|isbn=978-1405103459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallis|first=C|title=The Evolution Wars|publisher=Time Magazine|year=2005|pages=32|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1090909,00.html|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theobald&quot;/&gt; For example, the fact that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than the [[great apes]] offered a testable hypotheses involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor. The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that human chromosome 2 is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other primates. Extra, inactive [[telomeres]] and [[centromeres]] remain on human chromosome 2 as a result of the fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/evol07.sci.life.evo.genconnect/|title=Human Chromosome 2|publisher=2002-2008 WGBH Educational Foundation|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of [[DNA analysis]]. If true, human DNA should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other mammals. If not, then common descent is falsified.  DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html |title=Chimps are human, gene study implies |accessdate=2008-05-10 |author=Jeff Hecht |date=2003-05-19 |work= |publisher=NewScientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the evolution of [[chimpanzee]]s and humans from a common ancestor predicts a (geologically) recent common ancestor. Numerous transitional fossils have since been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/ |title=Fossil Hominids: The Evidence for Human Evolution |accessdate=2008-05-10 |author=Jim Foley |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, human evolution has passed several falsifiable tests.

A related claim, also once used, but then abandoned, by Popper, is that [[natural selection]] is [[tautology (logic)|tautological]].&lt;ref name=&quot;popper&quot;/&gt; Specifically, it is often argued that the phrase &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; is a tautology, in that [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is defined as ability to survive and reproduce. However, this phrase, first used by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, is rarely used by biologists. Additionally, fitness is more accurately defined as the state of possessing traits that make survival more likely; this definition, unlike simple &quot;survivability&quot;, avoids being trivially true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=JS|year=1997|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.html|title=Evolution and Philosophy:  A Good Tautology is Hard to Find|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aig&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[http://www.answersingenesis.org Answers in Genesis]|year=2006|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/Home/Area/faq/dont_use.asp|title=Arguments we think creationists should NOT use|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Survival of the fittest]] for a more thorough discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it is argued that evolutionary theory is [[circular reasoning]], in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological [[stratum|strata]] are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in.&lt;ref name=&quot;morris&quot;/&gt; However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by [[radiometric dating]], and many strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacRae|first=A|year=1998|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html|title=Radiometric dating and the geological time scale: Circular reasoning or reliable tools|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Philip Kitcher]] specifically addresses the &quot;falsifiability&quot; question by taking into account notable philosophical critiques of Popper by [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] that reject his definition of theory as a set of falsifiable statements.&lt;ref&gt;Hempel. C.G. 1951 “Problems and Changes in the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning” in ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation''. Glencoe: the Free Press.  Quine, W.V.O 1952 “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” reprinted in ''From a Logical Point of View''.  Cambridge: Harvard University Press &lt;/ref&gt; As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of “theory,” observations of [[Uranus]] when first discovered in 1781 would have “falsified” [[Issac Newton|Newton]]’s [[celestial mechanics]]. Rather, people suggested that  another planet influenced Uranus’ orbit – and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed.  Kitcher agrees with Popper that “there is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail.”&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher  1982 p 45&lt;/ref&gt; But he insists that we view scientific theories as consisting of an “elaborate collection of statements,” some of which are not falsifiable, and others – what he calls “auxiliary hypotheses,” which are.

According to Kitcher, good scientific theories must have three features: (1) unity: “A science should be unified …. Good theories consist of just one problem-solving strategy, or a small family of problem-solving strategies, that can be applied to a wide range of problems”  (1982: 47). (2) Fecundity:  “A great scientific theory, like Newton’s, opens up new areas of research. …. Because a theory presents a new way of looking at the world, it can lead us to ask new questions, and so to embark on new and fruitful lines of inquiry …. Typically, a flourishing science is incomplete.  At any time, it raised more questions than it can currently answer.  But incompleteness is no vice.  On the contrary, incompleteness is the mother of fecundity …. A good theory should be productive; it should raise new questions and presume that those questions can be answered without giving up its problem-solving strategies” (1982: 47-48).  (3) auxiliary hypothesis that are independently testable: “An auxiliary hypothesis ought to be testable independently of the particular problem it is introduced to solve, independently of the theory it is designed to save” (1982: 46) (e.g. the evidence for the existence of [[Neptune]] is independent of the anomalies in Uranus’s orbit).

Like other definitions of theories, including Popper’s, Kitcher  makes it clear that a good theory includes statements that have (in his terms) “observational consequences.”  But, like the observation of irregularities in Uranus’s orbit, falsification is only one possible consequence of an observation.  The production of new hypotheses is another possible – and equally important – observational consequence.  Kitcher’s account of a good theory is based not only on his understanding of how physical sciences work.  He is also taking into account the way the [[life sciences]] work.

From Kitcher’s point of view, Darwinian theory not only meets the three conditions for a good scientific theory; it is without question an extraordinarily successful theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The heart of Darwinian evolutionary theory is a family of problem-solving strategies, related by their common employment of a particular style of historical narrative.  A Darwinian history is a piece of reasoning of the following general form.  The first step consists in a description of an ancestral population of organisms.  The reasoning proceeds by tracing the modification of the population through subsequent generations, showing how characteristics were selected, inherited, and became prevalent.  Reasoning like this can be used to answer a host of biological questions.&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher 1982 p 50&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
The same kind of story can be told again and again to answer all sorts of questions about all sorts of living things.  Evolutionary theory is unified because so many diverse questions … can be addressed by advancing Darwinian histories.  Moreover, these narratives constantly make claims that are subject to independent check.&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher 1982 p 52&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
Darwin not only provided a scheme for unifying the diversity of life.  He also gave a structure to our ignorance.  After Darwin, it was important to resolve general issues about the presuppositions of Darwinian histories.  The way in which biology should proceed had been made admirably plain, and it was clear that biologists had to tackle questions for which they had, as yet, no answers.&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher 1982 pp 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Objections to evolution's evidence==
{{further|[[Evidence of evolution]]}}

Objections to the evidence that evolution occurs tend to be more concrete and specific, often involving direct analysis of [[evolutionary biology]]'s methods and claims.

===Evolution has never been observed===
[[Image:Archaeopteryx-model.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Transitional fossil|Transitional species]] such as the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have been a fixture of the [[creation-evolution controversy|creation-evolution debate]] for almost 150 years.]]

A common claim of creationists is that evolution has never been observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovinddvd&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people =[[Kent Hovind]]|title =The Dangers of Evolution|medium =DVD|publisher =Creation Science Evangelism|location =USA|year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined [[#Defining evolution|(see above)]]. Under the conventional biological definition of ''evolution'', it is a simple matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in many different scientific contexts, including the evolution of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], [[mice]] and [[bacteria]] in the laboratory,&lt;ref name=Buckling/&gt; and of [[tilapia]] in the field. Such studies on [[experimental evolution]], particularly those using [[microorganisms]], are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs.&lt;ref name=Buckling&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buckling A, Craig Maclean R, Brockhurst MA, Colegrave N |title=The Beagle in a bottle |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=824–9 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19212400 |doi=10.1038/nature07892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elena SF, Lenski RE |title=Evolution experiments with microorganisms: the dynamics and genetic bases of adaptation |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=457–69 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid= |doi=10.1038/nrg1088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such examples, many creationists specify that they are objecting only to [[macroevolution]], not [[microevolution]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbsef.org/FAQ.htm#Is%20TBSEF%20against%20teaching%20evolution? Questions frequently asked about the TBSEF], Texans for Better Science Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/kansas/kangaroo10.html Kansas Evolution Hearings Part 10], [[Kansas evolution hearings]]&lt;/ref&gt; most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor evolutionary changes, such as that observed even in [[dog breeding]]. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major evolutionary changes over long periods of time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.

However, as biologists define ''macroevolution'', both microevolution and macroevolution have been observed. [[Speciation]]s, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html#part5|title=Observed Instances of Speciation|first=Joseph|last=Boxhorn|year=1995|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] draws no distinction between macroevolution and microevolution, considering the former to simply be the latter on a larger scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theobald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=J|year=2006|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution.html|title=Macroevolution: Its Definition, Philosophy and History|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, past macroevolution can be inferred from historical traces. [[Transitional fossil]]s, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' linking birds and dinosaurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mayr G, Pohl B, Peters DS |title=A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features |journal=Science (journal) |volume=310 |issue=5753 |pages=1483–6 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16322455 |doi=10.1126/science.1120331}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the recently-discovered ''[[Tiktaalik]]'' linking fish and limbed amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shubin NH, Daeschler EB, Jenkins FA |title=The pectoral fin of Tiktaalik roseae and the origin of the tetrapod limb |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7085 |pages=764–71 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16598250 |doi=10.1038/nature04637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists dispute such examples in a variety of ways, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting that there should be far more evidence of obvious transitional species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|fist=K|year=1997|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html|title=Transitional Vertebrate Fossils FAQ|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species to be one of the greatest weaknesses of his theory: &quot;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&quot; Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the [[Silurian]] period. In later editions he added &quot;that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Charles Darwin|last=Darwin|first=C|year=1859|title=[[On the Origin of Species]]|publisher=John Murray}} [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=298 pp. 280–313], 4th edition of 1866, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F385&amp;pageseq=391 pp. 359–360]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elsberry|first=WR|year=1998|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/feb98.html|title=Missing links still missing!|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationists counter that even observed speciations and transitional fossils are insufficient evidence for the vast changes summarized by such phrases as &quot;fish to philosophers&quot; or &quot;particles to people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/0806faithful.asp|title=A faithful man takes on faith-based teaching|publisher=[http://www.answersingenesis.org Answers in Genesis]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more and more compelling direct evidence for inter-species and species-to-species evolution has been gathered, creationists have redefined their understanding of what amounts to a &quot;[[created kind]]&quot;, and have continued to insist that more dramatic demonstrations of evolution be experimentally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wieland|first=C|year=1991|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v5/i1/kind.asp|title=Variation, information and the created kind|journal=Journal of Creation|volume=5|issue=1|pages=42–47|accessdate=2007-03-24|format={{dead link|date=April 2009}} &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AWieland+intitle%3AVariation%2C+information+and+the+created+kind&amp;as_publication=Journal+of+Creation&amp;as_ylo=1991&amp;as_yhi=1991&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this objection is &quot;Were you there?&quot;, popularized by [[Ken Ham]]. It argues that because no one except God could directly observe events in the distant past, scientific claims are just speculation or &quot;story-telling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Ken Ham|last=Ham|first=Ken|year=1989|url=http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=670|title=Were You There?|publisher=[http://www.icr.org Institute for Creation Research]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2005|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA221.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA221: Were you there?|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA sequences of the [[genome]]s of organisms allow an independent test of their predicted relationships, since species which diverged more recently will be more closely related genetically than species which are more distantly related; such [[phylogenetic trees]] show a hierarchical organization within the [[tree of life (science)|tree of life]], as predicted by common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huelsenbeck JP, Rannala B |title=Phylogenetic methods come of age: testing hypotheses in an evolutionary context |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5310 |pages=227–32 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=9092465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Delsuc F, Brinkmann H, Philippe H |title=Phylogenomics and the reconstruction of the tree of life |journal=Nat.

In fields such as [[astrophysics]] or [[meteorology]], where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravitation]] was replaced by Einstein's theory of [[General Relativity]] when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref name = Ein1916&gt; {{cite journal| last = Einstein| first = Albert| authorlink = Albert Einstein| coauthors = | title = The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity| journal = Annalen der Physik| volume =  49 | issue = | pages = 769–822| year = 1916| publisher = | url = http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html| format = [[PDF]]| id =  | accessdate = 2006-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Past evidence for evolution has been overturned===
[[Image:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]]'s [[embryo drawings]] are an example of 19th century evidence which has been debunked by later evolutionary scientists, but critics of evolution misrepresent their use to claim that modern demonstrations of evolution are similarly erroneous or fraudulent.]]

A related objection is that evolution is based on unreliable evidence. This objection goes further than the less substantial &quot;evolution isn't proven&quot; arguments, claiming that evolution isn't even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution is likely to be overturned because some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.

Arguments against evolution's reliability are thus often based on analyzing the [[history of evolutionary thought]] or the [[history of science]] in general. Creationists point out that in the past, major [[paradigm shift|scientific revolutions]] have overturned theories that were at the time considered near-certain. They thus claim that current evolutionary theory is likely to undergo such a revolution in the future, on the basis that it is a &quot;[[#Evolution is controversial or disputed|theory in crisis]]&quot; for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA110.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA110: Evolution will soon be widely rejected.|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of evolution commonly appeal to past scientific [[hoax]]es such as the [[Piltdown Man]] [[archaeological forgery|forgery]]. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects of evolution, some or all of the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution has been accused of being fraudulent at various times, including ''Archaeopteryx'', [[peppered moth evolution|peppered moth melanism]], and [[Darwin's finches]]; these claims have been subsequently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nedin|first=C|year=1997|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/archaeopteryx/forgery.html|title=On Archaeopteryx, Astronomers, and Forgery|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wells&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|last=Wells|first=J|year=2002|title=Icons of Evolution|publisher=Regnery Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0895262004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/|title=Icons of Evolution FAQs|year=2006|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that certain former pieces of evidence for evolution which are now considered out-of-date and erroneous, such as [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s 19th-century [[embryo drawings]], were not merely errors but frauds. [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]]  criticizes biology [[textbook]]s by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence after it has been debunked.&lt;ref name=&quot;wells&quot;/&gt; In response, the [[National Center for Science Education]] notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells make the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion about why they are wrong, and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.&lt;ref name=Icon4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/icon-4-haeckels-embryos |title=Icon 4 — Haeckel's Embryos |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]|date=November 23, 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution's evidence is unreliable or inconsistent===
Creationists claim that evolution relies on certain types of evidence that do not give reliable information about the past. It is argued, for example, that [[radiometric dating]], the technique of evaluating a material's age based on the [[radioactive decay]] rates of certain [[isotope]]s, generates inconsistent, and thus unreliable, results. [[Radiocarbon dating]], based on the [[Carbon 14]] isotope, has been particularly criticized. It is argued that radiometric decay relies on a number of unwarranted assumptions, such as the principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], consistent decay rates, or rocks acting as [[closed system]]s. Such arguments have been dismissed by scientists on the grounds that a variety of independent methods have confirmed the reliability of radiometric dating as a whole; additionally, different radiometric dating methods and techniques have independently confirmed each other's results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD010.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CD010: Radiometric Dating|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of this objection is that [[fossil]] evidence is not reliable. This is based on a much wider range of claims. These include that there are too many &quot;gaps&quot; in the fossil record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, CC200: Transitional fossils|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC200_1.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, CC200.1: Transitional fossil abundance|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fossil-dating is circular (see [[#Evolution is unfalsifiable|evolution is unfalsifiable]]), or that certain fossils, such as [[polystrate fossil]]s, are seemingly &quot;out of place&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CC/CC340.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, CC340: Out-of-place fossils|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that certain features of evolution support creationism's [[catastrophism]] (cf.

==Objections to evolution's plausibility==
Some of the oldest and most common objections to evolution dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, God, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.

===Life is too unlikely to arise by chance===
{{further|[[Teleological argument]], [[Watchmaker analogy]], [[Evolutionary argument against naturalism]]}}
[[Image:WilliamPaley.jpg|frame|left|Because the theory of evolution is often thought of as the idea that life arose &quot;by chance&quot;, [[teleological argument|design arguments]] such as [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]] have been popular objections to the theory since Darwin's day.&lt;ref name=&quot;chance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=J|year=1997|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/chance/chance.html|title=Evolution and Chance|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An exceedingly prevalent objection to evolution is that it is simply too unlikely for life, in all its complexity and apparent &quot;design&quot;, to have arisen &quot;by chance&quot;. It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable ''not'' to infer an [[intelligent designer]] from the natural world, and specifically from the [[biodiversity|diversity of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Battern|first=D|year=1995|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i2/chance.asp|title=Cheating with chance|publisher=[http://www.answersingenesis.org Answers in Genesis]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more extreme version of this argument is that [[#Evolution cannot create complex structures|evolution cannot create complex structures]]. The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved on Earth is often encapsulated with a quotation that the &quot;probability of life originating on earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane sweeping through a scrap-yard would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]&quot; (a claim attributed to astrophysicist [[Fred Hoyle]] and known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;).

This view is thus invariably justified with arguments from [[analogy]]. The basic idea of this argument for a designer is the [[teleological argument]], an argument for the [[existence of God]] based on the perceived order or purposefulness of the universe. A common way of using this as an objection to evolution is by appealing to the 18th-century philosopher [[William Paley]]'s [[watchmaker analogy]], which argues that certain natural phenomena are analogical to a watch (in that they are ordered, or complex, or purposeful), which means that, like a watch, they must have been designed by a &quot;watchmaker&quot;&amp;mdash;an intelligent agent. This argument forms the core of [[intelligent design]], a neocreationist movement seeking to establish certain variants of the design argument as legitimate science, rather than as philosophy or [[theology]], and have them be taught alongside evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SM07/&gt;

This objection is fundamentally an [[argument from ignorance|argument by lack of imagination]], or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being [[counter-intuitive]], and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution is not based on &quot;chance&quot;, but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the &quot;designer&quot;. Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem &quot;designed&quot; is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the apparent design of [[snow#snowflake|snowflakes]] is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehoya.com/news/011306/news7.cfm News | The Hoya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of [[abiogenesis]], that certain structures demonstrate [[argument from poor design|poor design]], and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chance&quot;/&gt;

It has also been noted that arguments against some form of life arising &quot;by chance&quot; are really objections to nontheistic [[abiogenesis]], not to evolution. Indeed, many arguments against &quot;evolution&quot; are based on the misconception that abiogenesis is a component of, or necessary precursor to, evolution. Similar objections sometimes conflate the [[Big Bang]] with evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;moran&quot;/&gt;

Christian apologist and philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], a supporter of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution [[#Evolution doesn't explain enough|cannot account for]] the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God would be expected to create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Alvin Plantinga|last=Plantinga|first=A|year=1993|doi=10.1093/0195078640.001.0001|title=Warrant and Proper Function|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507864-0|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This novel [[epistemology|epistemological]] argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, is more likely to be selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitelson|first=B|coauthors=Sober, E|year=1997|url=http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf|format=PDF|title=Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2005|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA120.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CA120: Mind's fallibility|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution does not explain certain human behaviors===
It is frequently argued that a great weakness of evolutionary theory is that it does not, or cannot, explain a certain aspect of the natural world. Although there is broad agreement that certain aspects of life remain unexplained, some creationists argue that evolution should be abandoned altogether because of the phenomena it does not explain. Many argue that an alternative explanation, such as [[intelligent design]], can explain the things which evolution cannot. For example, [[Michael Behe]] has argued that current evolutionary theory cannot account for [[#Evolution cannot create complex structures|certain complex structures]], particularly in microbiology. On this basis, Behe argues that such structures were &quot;purposely arranged by an intelligent agent&quot; (see [[argument from incredulity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Michael Behe|last=Behe|first=MJ|url=http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_dm11496.htm|title=Darwin under the microscope|publisher=New York Times|date=[[1996-10-29]]|page=25|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to complex structures and systems, among the many phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are [[consciousness]], [[free will]], [[hominid intelligence]], [[instinct]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[metamorphosis]], [[photosynthesis]], [[homosexuality]], [[music]], [[language]], [[religion]], [[morality]], and [[altruism]] (see [[altruism in animals]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=P|year=1990|url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/pjdogma1.htm|title=Evolution as dogma: The establishment of naturalism|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these{{Which?|date=March 2009}} have, in fact, been well-explained by evolution, while others remain largely mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. However, supporters of evolution contend that no alternative explanation has been able to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.

In some cases, creationists argue against evolution on the grounds that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as [[abiogenesis]], the [[Big Bang]], or the [[meaning of life]]. In such instances, ''evolution'' is being [[#Defining evolution|redefined]] to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE440.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CE440: The origin of it all|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org theTalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections to evolution's possibility==
This class of objections is more radical than the above, claiming that some major aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in such a way that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.

===Evolution cannot create complex structures===
{{further|[[Irreducible complexity]]}}
[[Image:Eye iris.jpg|thumb|250px|An objection often made by creationists to evolutionary theory is that it allegedly cannot account for the development of complex organs such as the [[evolution of the eye|eye]].]]

Darwinian evolution posits that all biological systems must have developed incrementally from functional simpler systems. Every stage in the development of, for example, a fin into a leg, must have been sufficiently beneficial to be [[natural selection|selected]] for. Both Darwin and his early detractors recognized the potential problems that could arise for evolutionary theory if the lineage of organs and other biological features could not be accounted for by such gradual, step-by-step changes over successive generations; if all the intermediary stages between an initial organ and the organ it will become are not all improvements upon the original, it will be impossible for the later organ to develop. Anticipating early criticisms that the [[evolution of the eye]] and other complex organs seemed impossible, Darwin noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[R]eason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Richard Dawkins]] said on the topic of the evolution of the [[feather]] in an interview for the television program [[The Atheism Tapes]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's got to be a series of advantages all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to hairiness among reptiles keeping warm.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite creationist arguments such as &quot;What use is half an eye?&quot; and &quot;What use is half a wing?&quot;, subsequent research has confirmed that the natural evolution of such organs is entirely feasible.&lt;ref name=Gehring2005&gt;{{cite journal

The Loom: A blog about life, past and future |accessdate=2007-09-22 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationist claims have persisted that such complexity evolving without a designer is inconceivable, however, and this objection to evolution has been refined in recent years as the more sophisticated [[irreducible complexity]] argument of the [[intelligent design movement]], formulated by biochemist [[Michael Behe]].&lt;ref name=SM07/&gt;

Irreducible complexity is the idea that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity has been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the [[coagulation#The coagulation cascade|blood clotting cascade]], the [[immune system]], and the [[bacterial flagellum]] are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Michael Behe|last=Behe|first=MJ|year=1996|title=[[Darwin's Black Box]]: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0743290319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent years since Behe proposed irreducible complexity, new developments and advances in biology, such as an improved understanding of the [[evolution of flagella]], have already undermined many of these arguments. The idea that seemingly irreducibly complex systems cannot evolve has been refuted through a variety of evolutionary mechanisms, such as [[exaptation]] (the adaptation of organs for entirely new functions) and the use of &quot;scaffolding&quot;, which are initially necessary features of a system that later degenerate when they are no longer required. Additionally, potential evolutionary pathways have been provided for all of the systems Behe used as examples of irreducible complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2005|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB200.html|title=Index to Creationist Claims, Claim CB200: Irreducible complexity|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robison|first=K|year=1996|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe/review.html|title=Darwin's Black Box: Irreducible Complexity or Irreproducible Irreducibility?|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution cannot create information===
{{further|[[Physical information]], [[Biosemiotics]]}}

Another new, and increasingly common, objection of creationists to evolution is that evolutionary mechanisms such as [[mutation]] cannot generate new [[physical information|information]]. Creationists such as [[William A. Dembski]], [[Werner Gitt]], and [[Lee Spetner]] have attempted to use [[information theory]] to dispute evolution. Dembski has argued that life demonstrates [[specified complexity]], and that evolution without an [[intelligent designer|intelligent agent]] cannot account for the generation of information that would be required to produce specified complexity. The Christian apologetics site [[Answers in Genesis]], for example, makes frequent appeals to concepts from information theory in its objections to evolution and affirmations of the [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis account of Creation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t should be clear that a rigorous application of the science of information is devastating to materialistic philosophy in the guise of evolution, and strongly supportive of Genesis creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Gitt|Gitt, Werner]] (1996). ''[http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v10/i2/information.asp Information, science and biology]''. [[Answers in Genesis]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, these claims have been widely rejected by the scientific community; new information is regularly generated in evolution, whenever a novel mutation or [[gene duplication]] arises. Dramatic examples of entirely new, unique traits arising through mutation have been observed in recent years, such as the evolution of [[nylon-eating bacteria]], which developed new [[enzyme]]s to efficiently digest a material that never existed before the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Musgrave|first=I|coauthors=Baldwin, R, ''et al.''|year=2005|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/infotheory.html|title=Information Theory and Creationism|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=D|url=http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm|title=Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug|publisher=New Mexicans for Science and Reason|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, when an organism is considered together with the environment it evolved in, there is no need to account for the creation of information. The information in the genome forms a record of how it was possible to survive in a particular environment. It is not created, but rather gathered from the environment through research&amp;mdash;by [[trial and error]], as mutating organisms either reproduce or fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergstrom|first=CT|coauthors=Lachmann, M|title=The fitness value of information|year=2006|url=http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio.PE/0510007|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related argument against evolution is that all or most mutations are harmful. However, in reality the vast majority of mutations are [[neutral mutation|neutral]], and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harter|first=R|year=1999|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mutations.html|title=Are Mutations Harmful?|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics===
{{further|[[Entropy and life]]}}

Another objection is that evolution violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that &quot;the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium&quot;. In other words, an ideal isolated system's [[entropy]] (a measure of the dispersal of energy in a physical system so that it is not available to do mechanical work) will tend to increase or stay the same, not decrease. Creationists argue that evolution violates this [[physical law]] by requiring a decrease in entropy, or disorder, over time.&lt;ref name=crutch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=F|url=http://www.entropysite.com/cracked_crutch.html|title=Disorder — A Cracked Crutch For Supporting Entropy Discussions|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|year=2002|volume=79|pages=187–192|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this claim ignores the fact that this law applies only to [[isolated system]]s, which do not exchange matter or energy with their surroundings. Organisms, in contrast, are open systems, as all organisms constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. Similarly, the Earth absorbs energy from the Sun and emits energy back into space. The Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law, because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of [[self-organization|self-organizing]] life.&lt;ref name=Isaak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oerter|first=RN|year=2006|url=http://physics.gmu.edu/~roerter/EvolutionEntropy.htm|title=Does Life On Earth Violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics?|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the second law of thermodynamics has a precise mathematical definition, this argument can be analyzed quantitatively.  This was done by [[physicist]] Daniel Styer,&lt;ref name= &quot;Styer&quot;&gt;Daniel F. Styer, &quot;Entropy and evolution,&quot; ''Am. J. Phys., 76'', No. 11, Nov. 2008, 1031,&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded &quot;Quantitative estimates of the entropy involved in biological evolution demonstrate that there is no conflict between evolution and the second law of thermodynamics.&quot;

In a published letter to the editor of ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'' titled &quot;How anti-evolutionists abuse mathematics&quot;, [[mathematician]] Jason Rosenhouse stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact is that natural forces routinely lead to decreases in entropy. Water freezes into ice and fertilised eggs turn into babies. Plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen, but [we do] not invoke divine intervention to explain the process [...] thermodynamics offers nothing to dampen our confidence in Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.math.jmu.edu/~rosenhjd/sewell.pdf|format=PDF|title=How Anti-Evolutionists Abuse Mathematics |year=2001|last=Rosenhouse|first=J|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=23|issue=4|pages=3–8|accessdate=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Objections to evolution's moral implications==
Other common objections to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It is argued that the teaching of evolution degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters [[irreligion]] or [[atheism]].  All of these may be considered [[appeal to consequences|appeals to consequences]] (a form of [[logical fallacy]]), as the potential ramifications of belief in evolutionary theory have nothing to do with its objective empirical reality.

===Evolution says that humans are animals===
[[Image:Darwin ape.jpg|right|thumb|This satirical 1871 image of [[Charles Darwin]] as an ape parodied early objections to [[human evolution]].]]

Even though biology has long shown that humans are animals, and the Bible itself states this in [[Ecclesiastes]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Ecclesiastes#Chapter 3|3:18–21]], many people feel that humans should be separate from, and superior to, animals. The mediaeval concept of a [[great chain of being]] set out a static hierarchy in which humans are &quot;above&quot; animals, but below angels and God, and monarchs were born to rule. As evolutionary thought developed it was feared that [[human evolution]] implied that there was no real separation between man and brute, and that it undermined human social hierarchy. Assertions of ape ancestry in the 1844 publication ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges of Creation]]'' gained much public acceptance but were scornfully attacked by establishment scientists, and though Darwin avoided the subject when announcing his theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, the issue was quickly raised. Some anatomists claimed that humans had unique physical features; however, English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] showed that they were wrong and overcame their opposition to Darwin's ideas. Evolutionary [[common descent]] does not imply that human beings should behave like other animals, but instead shows that all animals behave in different ways, and teaches that humans behave like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isaak|first=M|year=2004|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA009.html|title=Claim CA009: Evolution teaches that people are animals. We should not be surprised when people who are taught evolution start behaving like animals|publisher=[http://www.talkorigins.org The TalkOrigins Archive]|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many still object to the idea that all diversity in life, including human beings, arose through [[natural science|natural]] processes without a need for supernatural intervention, and [[creationism|creationists]] argue against evolution on the basis that it contradicts their literal interpretation of [[creation myth]]s about separate &quot;kinds&quot;. However, many religions, such as [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through [[theistic evolution]].

===Evolution leads to immorality and social ills===

He also writes, &quot;I'm not saying that evolution is the cause of abortion or school violence.

Supporters of evolution dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and some argue that the opposite seems to be the case. There is a published study by author and illustrator [[Gregory S. Paul]] demonstrating that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2005/2005-11.html|title=Cross-National Correlations of Quantifiable Societal Health with Popular Religiosity and Secularism in the Prosperous Democracies: A First Look|first=GS|last=Paul|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Society|volume=7|year=2005|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;br&gt;
The paper was criticized by Moreno-Riaño, Smith, and Mach in [http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2006/2006-1.html a published article in the same journal] because &quot;[Paul 's] methodological problems do not allow for any conclusive statement to be advanced regarding the various hypotheses Paul seeks to demonstrate or falsify.&quot; Of course, correlation does not imply causality, and Paul does not produce any speculations about the cause of these correlations. &lt;/ref&gt;  The [[George Barna|Barna Group]] surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the US have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the US are among [[Baptists]] and [[Pentecostals]], both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&amp;BarnaUpdateID=170|title=Born Again Christians Just As Likely to Divorce As Are Non-Christians|year=2004|publisher=[http://www.barna.org The Barna Group]|accessdate=2004-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]] argued in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite journal|title=Darwin on the Right: Why Christians and conservatives should accept evolution|first=M|last=Shermer|journal=[[Scientific American]]|year=2006|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00068F43-E189-150E-A18983414B7F0000&amp;colID=13|accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shermer also suggests that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists.

A common phrase in [[evolutionary biology]]. Divergent species is the direct consequence of [[adaptive radiation]]. Divergent species occurs when a part of the species is separated from the population by a physical barrier (flood waters, mountain range, deserts). Once separated, the species begins to adapt to their new environment (natural selection). After many generations and continual evolution of the separated species, the population eventually becomes two separate species to such an extent where they are no longer able to interbreed with one another. 

An example of divergent species is the apple maggot fly. The apple maggot fly once infested  the fruit of a native Australian hawthorn. In the 1860s some maggot flies began to infest apples. They multiplied rapidly because they were able to make use of an abundant food supply. Now there are two distinct species, one that reproduces when the apples are ripe, and another that continues to infest the native hawthorn. Furthermore, they have not only evolved different reproductive timing, but also now have distinctive physical characteristics.

'''Galápagos Islands''' (Official name: ''Archipiélago de Colón''; other Spanish names: ''Islas de Colón'' or ''Islas Galápagos'') are an [[archipelago]] of [[Island#Volcanic islands|volcanic islands]] distributed around the [[equator]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], 972&amp;nbsp;km west of continental [[Ecuador]]. It is a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]]: wildlife is its most notable feature.

The Galápagos Islands form the [[Galápagos Province]] of Ecuador and are part of the country's national park system. The principal language on the islands is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The islands have a population of around 40,000, which is a 40-fold expansion in 50 years. 

The islands are geologically young and famed for their vast number of [[endemic species]], which were studied by [[Charles Darwin]] during [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the ''Beagle'']]. His observations and collections contributed to the [[inception of Darwin's theory]] of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. 

==Etymology==
&quot;Galápago&quot; is an old Spanish word, meaning saddle. The large [[Galápagos tortoise]] on some of the islands had a shell that resembled an old Spanish saddle, thus the name. The tortoise is a unique animal found only in the Galapagos Islands, yet there are no more than 200 in the 13 main islands. 

The archipelago has been known by many different names, including the &quot;Enchanted Islands,&quot; because of the way in which the strong and swift [[Ocean current|currents]] made [[Seamanship|navigation]] difficult and also because of the beautiful geography and biodiversity. 

The first crude [[nautical chart|navigation chart]] of the islands was done by the [[buccaneer]] [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684. He named the individual islands after some of his fellow [[pirate]]s or after the [[English people|English]] noblemen who helped the privateer's cause. More recently, the Ecuadorian government gave most of the islands Spanish names. While the Spanish names are official, many users (especially [[ecology|ecological]] researchers) continue to use the older English names, particularly as those were the names used when [[Charles Darwin]] visited. 
==Physical geography==
[[Image:Orthographic projection centred over the Galapagos.png|thumb|Orthographic projection centred over the Galápagos.]]
[[Image:Galapagos-satellite-esislandnames.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the Galápagos islands overlayed with the names of the visible main islands.]]
[[Image:Galapagos SPOT 1178.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Isabela seen from Spot Satellite]]

Located in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] at 973 km (604 miles) off the west coast of [[South America]]. The closest land mass is the mainland of [[Ecuador]] to the east (the country to which they belong), to the North is [[Cocos Island]] 720&amp;nbsp;km (447 miles) and to the South is [[Easter Island]] and San Felix Island at 3200 km (1,990 miles).

The islands are found at the coordinates 1°40'N-1°36'S, 89°16'-92°01'W. Straddling the equator, islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemisphere with Volcan Wolf and Volcano Ecuador on Isla [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela]] being directly on the equator line. [[Española Island|Española]] the southernmost island and [[Darwin Island|Darwin]] the northernmost island are spread out over a distance of 220&amp;nbsp;km (137 miles).

The Galapagos Archipelago consists of 7,880 square km (3,042 sq. miles) of land spread over 45,000 square km (28,000 miles) of ocean. The largest of the islands, [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela]], measures 4,640 square km and making up half of the total land area of the Galapagos. Volcan Wolf, on Isabela is the highest point with an elevation of 1,707 m (5,600 ft.) above sea level.

The group consists of 13 main islands, 6 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and [[islet]]s. The islands are located at the [[Galapagos Triple Junction]]. It is also atop the [[Galapagos hotspot]], a place where the Earth's crust is being melted from below by a [[mantle plume]], creating volcanoes. The oldest island is thought to have formed between 5 and 10 million years ago. The youngest islands, [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela]] and [[Fernandina Island|Fernandina]], are still being formed, with the most recent [[volcanic eruption]] in April 2009 where lava from the volcanic island Fernandina started flowing both towards the island's shoreline and into the center caldera.

===Main islands===
The main islands of the archipelago (with their [[English language|English]] names) shown alphabetically:

'''[[Baltra Island|Baltra (South Seymour) Island]]:''' Also known as South Seymour, Baltra is a small flat island located near the center of the Galapagos. It was created by Geological uplift. The island is very arid and vegetation consists of salt bushes, prickly pear cactus and palo santo trees.

Until 1986, Baltra Airport was the only airport serving the Galápagos. Now there are two airports which receive flights from the continent, the other located on [[San Cristóbal Island]]. Private planes flying to Galapagos must fly to Baltra as it is the only airport with facilities for planes overnight.

Arriving into Baltra all visitors are immediately transported by bus to one of two docks. The first dock is located in a small bay where the boats cruising Galapagos await passengers. The second is a ferry dock which connects Baltra to the island of Santa Cruz.

During the 1940s scientists decided to move 70 of Baltra's [[Galapagos Land Iguana|Land Iguanas]] to the neighboring [[North Seymour Island]] as part of an experiment. This move had unexpected results for during the military occupation of Baltra in World War II, the native iguanas became extinct on the island. During the 1980s iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] as part of a breeding and repopulation project and in the 1990s land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. As of 1997 scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra; 13 of which were born on the islands.

In 2007 and 2008 the Baltra airport is being remodeled to include additional restaurants, shops and an improved visitor area.

'''[[Bartolomé Island|Bartolomé (Bartholomew) Island]]:''' Bartolomé Island is a volcanic islet just off the east coast of Santiago Island in the Galápagos Islands Group. It is one of the &quot;younger&quot; islands in the Galápagos archipelago. It is named after Lieutenant David Bartholomew of the British Navy.

'''[[Darwin Island|Darwin (Culpepper) Island]]:''' This island is named after Charles Darwin. It has an area of 1.1 [[square kilometre]]s (0.4 [[square mile|sq mi]]) and a maximum altitude of 168 metres (551 ft). Here fur seals, frigates, [[Marine iguanas]], Swallow-tailed Gulls, sea lions, whales, marine turtles, Red-footed and Nazca boobies can be seen.

[[Image:Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata) -Espanola -Punta Suarez3.jpg|thumb|[[Waved Albatross]]es on Española]]
'''[[Española Island|Española (Hood) Island]]:''' Its name was given in honor of [[Spain]]. It also is known as ''Hood'' after [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Viscount Samuel Hood]]. It has an area of 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 206 metres (676 ft).

Española is the oldest island at around 3.5 million years and the southernmost in the chain. The island's remote location has a large number of endemic [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]]. Secluded from the other islands, wildlife on Española adapted to the island's environment and natural resources. [[Marine Iguana|Marine iguanas]] on Española are the only ones that change color during breeding season.

The [[Waved Albatross]] is found on the island. The island's steep cliffs serve as the perfect runways for these large birds which take off for their ocean feeding grounds near the mainland of Ecuador and Peru.

Española has two visitor sites. Gardner Bay is a swimming and snorkeling site as well as offering a great beach. Punta Suarez has migrant, resident, and endemic wildlife including brightly colored [[Marine Iguana]], Española Lava Lizards, [[Hood Mockingbird]]s, [[Swallow-tailed Gull]]s, [[Blue-footed Booby]],[[Red-Footed Booby]] and [[Nazca Booby|Nazca Boobies]], Galápagos Hawks, a selection of Finch, and the [[Waved Albatross]].

'''[[Fernandina Island|Fernandina (Narborough) Island]]:''' The name was given in honor of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, who sponsored the voyage of Columbus. Fernandina has an area of 642 square kilometres (248 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 1,494 metres (4,902 ft). This is the youngest and westernmost island. In May 13, 2005, a new very eruptive process began on this island when an ash and water vapour cloud rose to a height of 7 kilometers (4.4 mi) and lava flows descended the slopes of the volcano on the way to the sea. Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of Marine Iguanas gather largely on black lava rocks. The famous [[Flightless Cormorant]] inhabits this island and also [[Galápagos Penguin]]s, [[Pelican]]s and Sea Lions are abundant. Different types of [[lava flow]]s can be compared and the [[Mangrove]] Forests can be observed.

'''[[Floreana Island|Floreana (Charles or Santa María) Island]]:''' It was named after [[Juan José Flores]], the first [[president]] of [[Ecuador]], during whose administration the government of Ecuador took possession of the archipelago. It is also called [[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa Maria]] after one of the [[caravel]]s of Columbus. It has an area of 173 square kilometres (66.8 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 640 metres (2,100 ft). It is one of the islands with the most interesting human history and one of the earliest to be inhabited. [[Flamingo]]s and green sea turtles nest (December to May) on this island. The &quot;patapegada&quot; or [[Dark-rumped Petrel|Galápagos Petrel]] is found here, a sea bird which spends most of its life away from land. At Post Office Bay, since the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century [[Whaling|whalers]] kept a [[Barrel (storage)|wooden barrel]] that served as [[post office]] so that mail could be picked up and delivered to their destination mainly [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] by ships on their way home. At the “Devil's Crown”, an underwater [[volcanic cone]], [[coral]] formations are found.

'''[[Genovesa Island|Genovesa (Tower) Island]]:''' The name is derived from [[Genoa]], [[Italy]] where it is said [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was born. It has an area of 14 square kilometres (5.4 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 76 metres (249 ft). This island is formed by the remaining edge of a large [[Impact crater|crater]] that is submerged. Its nickname of “the bird island” is clearly justified. At Darwin Bay, [[frigatebird]]s and[[Swallow-tailed Gull|swallow-tailed gulls]],  the only nocturnal species of gull in the world, can be seen. Red-footed [[booby|boobies]], noddy [[tern]]s, lava gulls, tropic birds, [[dove]]s, [[storm petrel]]s and [[Darwin's finches|Darwin finches]] are also in sight. Prince Philip's &lt;!-- which prince Philip? --&gt; Steps is a bird-watching [[plateau]] with Nazca and red-footed boobies. There is a large Palo Santo forest.

[[Image:Galapagos iguana1.jpg|thumb|Galapagos marine iguana]]
'''[[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Isabela (Albemarle) Island (Ecuador)]]:''' This island was named in honor of Queen Isabela. With an area of 4,640 square kilometers (1,792 sq mi), it is the largest island of the Galápagos. Its highest point is Wolf Volcano with an altitude of 1,707 meters (5,600 ft). The island's [[seahorse]] shape is the product of the merging of six large volcanoes into a single landmass. On this island [[Galápagos Penguin]]s, [[Flightless Cormorant]]s, [[Marine Iguana]]s, [[pelican]]s and [[Grapsus grapsus|Sally Lightfoot crabs]] abound. At the skirts and calderas of the volcanos of Isabela, Land Iguanas and Galápagos Tortoises can be observed, as well as [[Darwin's finches|Darwin Finches]], Galápagos Hawks, Galápagos Doves and very interesting lowland vegetation. The third-largest human settlement of the archipelago, [[Puerto Villamil]], is located at the south-eastern tip of the island.

'''[[Marchena Island|Marchena (Bindloe) Island]]:''' Named after Fray Antonio Marchena. Has an area of 130 square kilometres (50 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 343 metres (1,125 ft).
[[Galápagos hawks]] and sea lions inhabit this island, and it is home to the Marchena Lava Lizard, an endemic animal.

'''[[Nameless Island]]:''' The small islet is used mostly for [[scuba diving]].

'''[[North Seymour Island]]:''' Its name was given after an English nobleman called [[Lord Hugh Seymour]]. It has an area of 1.9 square kilometres (0.7 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 28 metres (92 ft). This island is home to a large population of [[Blue-footed Booby|blue-footed boobies]] and [[Swallow-tailed Gull|swallow-tailed gulls]]. It hosts one of the largest populations of frigate birds. It was formed from geological uplift.

Just north of the [[Seymour Airport|Baltra Airport]] is the small islet of North Seymour. North Seymour was created by seismic uplift rather than being of volcanic origin. The island has a flat profile with cliffs only a few meters from the shoreline, where swallowtail gulls and [[tropicbird]]s sit perched in ledges. A tiny forest of silver-grey [[Palo santo]]trees stand just above the landing, usually without leaves, waiting for rain to bring them into bloom. The island is teeming with life. Visiting the island you may have to give way to a passing sea lion or [[Marine Iguana|marine iguana]]. Flocks of pelicans and swallow tailed gulls feed off shore and seasonally masked boobies can also be seen.

North Seymour is an extraordinary place for breeding birds and is home to one of the largest populations of nesting blue-footed boobies and magnificent frigate birds. Pairs of blue-footed boobies can be seen conducting their mating ritual as they offer each other gifts, whistle and honk, stretch their necks towards the sky, spread their wings, and dance--showing off their bright blue feet. [[frigatebirds|Magnificent frigatebirds]] perch in low bushes, near the boobies, while watching over their large chicks. The frigates are huge, dark acrobats with a {{convert|90|in|m|sing=on}} wingspan. Male frigates can puff up their scarlet throat sacks to resemble a giant red balloon. Boobies and frigates have an interesting relationship. Boobies are excellent hunters and fish in flocks. The frigates by comparison are pirates, they dive bomb the boobies to force them to drop their prey. Then the acrobatic frigate swoops down and picks up the food before it hits the water.

'''[[Pinzón Island|Pinzón (Duncan) Island]]:''' Named after the Pinzón brothers, captains of the Pinta and Niña caravels. Has an area of 18 square kilometers (7 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 458 metres (1,503 ft).

'''[[Pinta Island|Pinta (Abingdon) Island]]:''' Named after the Pinta caravel. It has an area of 60 km² and a maximum altitude of 777 meters. Sea lions, [[Galápagos hawk]]s, giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and dolphins can be seen here. The Pinta island was home to the last remaining Pinta Tortoise, called [[Lonesome George]]. He does not actually live on Pinta Island any longer, he is at a research facility

'''[[Rábida Island|Rábida (Jervis) Island]]:''' It bears the name of the convent of Rábida where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas. Has an area of 4.9 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 367 metres (1,204 ft). The high amount of iron contained in the lava at Rábida gives it a distinctive red color. White-Cheeked Pintail Ducks live in a salt-water lagoon close to the beach, where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests. Up until recently, flamingos were also found in the salt-water lagoon, but they have since moved on to other islands, likely due to a lack of food on Rábida. Nine species of Finches have been reported in this island.

[[Image:Galapagos2007--39--08-22-07.JPG|thumb|Main Street on San Cristóbal Island]]

'''[[San Cristóbal Island|San Cristóbal (Chatham) Island]]:''' It bears the name of the Patron Saint of seafarers, &quot;[[St. Christopher]]&quot;. Its [[English language|English]] name was given after [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. It has an area of 558 square kilometres (215 sq mi) and its highest point rises to 730 metres (2395 ft). This islands hosts [[Frigatebird|frigate birds]], [[sea lion]]s, giant tortoises, [[Blue-footed Booby|blue]] and red footed [[booby|boobies]], tropicbirds, [[marine iguana]]s, [[dolphin]]s, swallow-tailed [[gull]]s. Its vegetation includes ''Calandrinia galapagos'', ''Lecocarpus darwinii'', and trees such as ''Lignum vitae''.The largest fresh water [[lake]] in the archipelago, Laguna El Junco, is located in the [[Highland (geography)|highland]]s of San Cristóbal. The capital of the province of Galápagos, [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]], lies at the southern tip of the island.

'''[[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz (Indefatigable) Island (Galápagos)]]:''' Given the name of the Holy Cross in Spanish, its English name derives from the British vessel [[HMS Indefatigable (1784)|HMS Indefatigable]]. It has an area of 986 square kilometres (381 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 864 metres (2834 ft). Santa Cruz is the island that hosts the largest human population in the archipelago at the town of [[Puerto Ayora]]. The [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] and the headquarters of the Galápagos National Park Service are located here. The GNPS and CDRS operate a tortoise breeding center here, where young tortoises are hatched, reared, and prepared to be reintroduced to their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The Highlands of Santa Cruz offer an exuberant vegetation and are famous for the lava tunnels. Large tortoise populations are found here. Black Turtle Cove is a site surrounded by mangrove which sea turtles, rays and small sharks sometimes use as a mating area. Cerro Dragón, known for its flamingo lagoon, is also located here, and along the trail one may see land iguanas foraging.

'''[[Santa Fe Island|Santa Fe (Barrington) Island]]:''' Named after a city in [[Spain]], has an area of 24 square kilometres (9 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 259 metres (850 ft). Santa Fe hosts a [[forest]] of [[Opuntia]] [[cactus]], which are the largest of the archipelago, and Palo Santo. Weathered [[cliff]]s provide a haven for swallow-tailed gulls, red-billed tropic birds, [[Shearwater|shear-waters petrels]]. [[Barrington Land Iguana|Santa Fe species]] of [[Galapagos Land Iguana|land iguanas]] are often seen, as well as [[lava lizard]]s.

'''[[Santiago Island (Galápagos)|Santiago (San Salvador, James) Island (Galápagos)]]:''' Its name is equivalent to Saint James in English; it is also known as San Salvador, after the first island discovered by Columbus in the Caribbean Sea. This island has an area of 585 square kilometers (226 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 907 metres (2976 ft). Marine iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, land and sea turtles, [[flamingo]]s, dolphins and sharks are found here. [[Pig]]s and [[goat]]s, which were introduced by humans to the islands and have caused great harm to the endemic species, have been eradicated (pigs in 2002; goat eradication is nearing finalization). [[Darwin's finches|Darwin Finches]] and Galápagos Hawks are usually seen as well as a colony of Fur Seals. At Sullivan Bay a recent (around 100&amp;nbsp;years ago) [[Lava|pahoehoe lava flow]] can be observed.

'''[[South Plaza Island]]:''' It is named in honor of a former president of Ecuador, General [[Leonidas Plaza]]. It has an area of 0.13 square kilometers (0.05 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 23 metres (75 ft). The flora of South Plaza includes Opuntia cactua and Sesuvium plants, which forms a reddish carpet on top of the lava formations. Iguanas (land and marine and some hybrids of both species) are abundant and there are a large number of birds that can be observed from the cliffs at the southern part of the island, including tropic birds and swallow-tailed gulls.

'''[[Wolf Island|Wolf (Wenman) Island]]:''' This island was named after the German geologist [[Theodor Wolf]]. It has an area of 1.3 square kilometres (0.5 sq mi)and a maximum altitude of 253 metres (830 ft). Here [[fur seal]]s, [[frigatebird]]s, [[masked booby|masked]] and [[red-footed boobies]], [[Marine Iguana]]s, [[shark]]s, [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[swallow-tailed gull]]s can be seen. The most famous resident is the [[vampire finch]], which feeds partly on blood pecked from other birds and is only found on this island.

===Minor islands===
{{main|Daphne Major}}

A small island directly north of Santa Cruz and directly west of Baltra, this very inaccessible island appears, though unnamed, on Ambrose Cowley's 1684 chart. It is important as the location of multi-decade finch population studies by [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]].

==Weather==
Although located on the Equator, the [[Humboldt Current]] brings cold water to the islands, causing frequent drizzles during most of the year. The weather is periodically influenced by the [[El Niño]] phenomenon which brings warmer temperatures and heavy rains.

During the season known as the &quot;Garua&quot; (June to November) the temperature by the sea is 22°C, a steady and cold wind blows from South and Southeast, and frequent drizzles (Garuas) last most of the day, along with dense fog which conceals the islands. During the warm season (December to May) the average sea and air temperature rises to 25°C, there is no wind at all, there are sporadic though strong rains and the sun shines.

Weather changes as altitude increases in the large islands. Temperature decreases gradually with altitude, while precipitation increases due to the condensation of moisture in clouds on the slopes. There is a large variation in precipitation from one place to another, not only with altitude but also depending on the location of the islands, and also with the seasons.

The following table corresponding to the wet 1969 shows the variation of precipitation in different places of Santa Cruz Island:

The precipitation also depends on the geographical location. During March 1969 the precipitation over Charles Darwin Station, on the southern coast of Santa Cruz was 249.0&amp;nbsp;mm, while on Baltra Island the precipitation during the same month was only 137.6&amp;nbsp;mm. This is due to the fact that Baltra is located behind Santa Cruz with respect to the prevailing southerly winds, so most of the moisture gets precipitated in the Santa Cruz highlands.

There are significant changes in precipitation from one year to another too. At Charles Darwin Station the precipitation during March 1969 was 249.0&amp;nbsp;mm, but during March 1970 it was only 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm.

==History==

European discovery of the Galápagos Islands occurred when Dominican [[Fray Tomás de Berlanga]], the fourth Bishop of [[Panama]], sailed to [[Peru]] to settle a dispute between [[Francisco Pizarro]] and his lieutenants. De Berlanga's vessel drifted off course when the winds diminished, and his party reached the islands on March 10, [[1535]]. According to a 1952 study by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and Arne Skjølsvold, remains of potshards and other artifacts from several sites on the islands suggest visitation by South American peoples prior to the arrival of the Spanish.

The islands first appeared on maps in about [[1570]] in those drawn by [[Abraham Ortelius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]]. The islands were called &quot;Insulae de los Galopegos&quot; (Islands of the Tortoises).

The first English captain to visit the Galápagos Islands was [[Richard Hawkins]], in [[1593]]. Until the early [[19th century]], the archipelago was often used as a hideout by mostly English pirates who pilfered Spanish [[galleon]]s carrying gold and silver from South America to Spain.

[[Alexander Selkirk]], whose adventures in [[Juan Fernández Islands]] inspired [[Daniel Defoe]] to write ''Robinson Crusoe'', visited the Galápagos in [[1708]] after he was picked up from Juan Fernández by the privateer [[Woodes Rogers]]. Rogers was refitting his ships in the islands after sacking [[Guayaquil]].

The first scientific mission to the Galápagos arrived in [[1790]] under the leadership of [[Alessandro Malaspina]], a Sicilian captain whose expedition was sponsored by the King of Spain. However, the records of the expedition were lost.

In [[1793]], [[James Colnett]] made a description of the flora and fauna of Galápagos and suggested that the islands could be used as base for the [[whaling|whalers]] operating in the Pacific Ocean. He also drew the first accurate navigation charts of the islands. Whalers killed and captured thousands of the Galápagos tortoises to extract their fat. The tortoises could also be kept on board ship as a means of providing of fresh protein as these animals could survive for several months on board without any food or water. The hunting of the tortoises was responsible for greatly diminishing, and in some cases eliminating, certain species. Along with whalers came the fur-seal hunters who brought the population of this animal close to extinction.

[[Ecuador]] annexed the Galápagos Islands on February 12, [[1832]], naming it [[Archipelago of Ecuador]]. This was a new name that added to several names that had been, and are still, used to refer to the archipelago. The first governor of Galápagos, General José de Villamil, brought a group of convicts to populate the island of Floreana and in October 1832 some artisans and farmers joined.

[[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']] brought the survey ship [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] under captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] to the Galápagos on September 15, [[1835]] to survey approaches to harbors. The captain and others on board including his companion the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] made a scientific study of geology and biology on Chatham, Charles, Albemarle and James islands before they left on October 20 to continue on their round-the-world expedition. Darwin noticed that [[mockingbird]]s differed between islands, though he thought the birds now known as [[Darwin's finches]] were unrelated to each other and did not bother labelling them by island.&lt;ref name=Confessions&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/|title=VQR - Confessions of a Darwinist|accessdate=2007-12-26|author=Niles Eldredge|authorlink=Niles Eldredge|date= Spring 2006|publisher=The Virginia Quarterly Review|pages=32–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Englishman Nicolas Lawson, acting Governor of Galápagos for the Republic of the Equator, met them on ''Charles Island'' and as they walked to the prison colony told him that tortoises differed from island to island. Towards the end of the voyage Darwin speculated that the distribution of the mockingbirds and the tortoises might &quot;undermine the stability of Species&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Richard ed. 2000. ''Charles Darwin's zoology notes &amp; specimen lists from H.M.S. Beagle.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1840&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=June 23 – August 1836], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1840&amp;pageseq=328 291–293]&lt;/ref&gt; When specimens of birds were analysed on his return to [[England]] it was found that many apparently different kinds of birds were species of [[finch]]es which were also unique to islands. These facts were crucial in Darwin's development of his theory of [[natural selection]] explaining [[evolution]], which was presented in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name=Confessions/&gt;

[[José Valdizán]] and [[Manuel Julián Cobos]] tried a new colonization, beginning the exploitation of a type of lichen found in the islands (Roccella portentosa) used as a coloring agent. After the assassination of Valdizán by some of his workers, Cobos brought from the continent a group of more than a hundred workers to San Cristóbal island and tried his luck at planting sugar cane. He ruled in his plantation with an iron hand which lead to his assassination in 1904. Since 1897 Antonio Gil began another plantation in Isabela island.

Over the course of a whole year, from September 1904, an expedition of the Academy of Sciences of California, led by Rollo Beck, stayed in the Galápagos collecting scientific material on [[geology]], [[entomology]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[herpetology]]. Another expedition from that Academy was done in 1932 (Templeton Crocker Expedition) to collect [[insect]]s, [[fish]], [[animal shell|shells]], [[fossil]]s, birds and plants.

During [[World War II]] Ecuador authorized the United States to establish a naval base in Baltra island and radar stations in other strategic locations. Baltra was also established as a US Air Force Base at this time. Crews stationed at Baltra patrolled the Pacific for enemy submarines as well as providing protection for the Panama Canal. After the war the facilities were given to the government of Ecuador. Today the island continues as an official Ecuadorian military base. The foundations and other remains of the US base can still be seen as one crosses the island.
In 1946 a penal colony was established in Isabela Island, but it was suspended in 1959.
The Galapagos became a national park in 1959 and tourism started in the 1960s.

==Political geography==
{{main|Galápagos Province}}

'''Galápagos''' was made a [[province]] in [[Ecuador]] by presidential decree by [[President of Ecuador|President]] [[Guillermo Rodriguez Lara]] on Feb. 18th, 1973. This decree was amended on March 16, 1973 to include the Isabela Canton.

The province is coincident with the Galápagos Islands. The capital is [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]]. The province is divided in 3 [[canton (subnational entity)|canton]]s.

'''San Cristobal Canton''' with capital in [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]]. It has the following parishes: '''Progreso''', with the following precincts: La Soledad, El Socavon, Tres Palos and El Chino, and '''Santa Maria Island''', with the town of Puerto Velasco Ibarra. The following Islands are under the jurisdiction of this Canton: Española, Santa Fe and Genovesa.

'''Santa Cruz Canton''', with capital in [[Puerto Ayora]]. Its has the following parishes: '''Bellavista''', with the precincts El Occidente, El Carmen, Santa Rosa, and Saasaca. Under its jurisdiction are the following Islands: Santiago, Marchena, Pinta, Pinzon, Rabida and Baltra.

'''Isabela Island''', with capital in [[Puerto Villamil]], and the following parishes: '''Tomás de Berlanga''', with its precincts: Las Merceditas, San Antonio de los Tintos, Cerro Azul and Alemania. Under the jurisdiction of this Canton are the Islands of
Fernandina, Wolf and Darwin.

There is a Provincial Judge, as well as Cantonal Judges to in each Canton to deal with misdemeanor cases, as well as Laboral Judges. But for felonies punishable with prison, the province is under the jurisdiction of the Criminal Courts of the Province of Guayas in mainland Ecuador. The causes can be delivered without the use of an attorney. All of the sentences delivered by Provincial and Cantonal Judges can be appealed to the Superior Court of Justice of Guayas Province with seat in Guayaquil.

It is expressely stated that it is the duty of the Provincial authorities to protect the flora and fauna of the Province in coordination with competent organisms and authorities, both national and international.

This [[province]] is in the [[UTC]]-6 [[time zone]]. The [[continent]]al part of [[Ecuador]] is in the [[UTC]]-5 time zone.

==Demographics==
It is one of the few places in the world without an indigenous population. The largest ethnic group is composed of Ecuadorian [[Mestizo]]s, the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Native Americans, who arrived mainly in the last century from the [[continent]]al part of [[Ecuador]].

In 1959, approximately 1,000 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;people called the islands their home. In 1972 a census was done in the archipelago and a population of 3,488 was recorded. By the 1980s, this number had risen to more than 15,000&amp;nbsp;people, and 2006 estimates place the population around 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.

Five of the islands are inhabited: Baltra, Floreana, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz.

Though the first protective legislation for the Galápagos was enacted in 1934 and supplemented in 1936, it was not until the late 1950s that positive action was taken to control what was happening to the native flora and fauna. In 1955, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature organized a fact-finding mission to the Galápagos. Two years later, in 1957, [[UNESCO]] in cooperation with the government of Ecuador sent another expedition to study the conservation situation and choose a site for a research station.

In 1959, the centenary year of [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', the Ecuadorian government declared 97.5% of the archipelago's land area a [[national park]], excepting areas already colonised. The [[Charles Darwin Foundation]] (CDF) was founded the same year. The core responsibility of CDF, an international non-governmental organization constituted in Belgium, is to conduct research and provide the research findings to the Government of Ecuador for effective management of Galapagos. CDF´s research efforts work began with the establishment of the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]] on Santa Cruz Island in 1964. During the early years conservation programs, such as eradication of introduced species and protection of native species, were carried out by research station personnel. Now much of that work is accomplished by the [[Galapagos National Park]] Service using the research findings and methodologies developed by CDF.

In 1986 the surrounding 70,000 square kilometres (43,496 sq mi.) of ocean was declared a [[marine reserve]], second only in size to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. In 1990 the archipelago became a whale sanctuary. In 1978 [[UNESCO]] recognised the islands as a [[World Heritage Site]], and in 1985 a [[Biosphere Reserve]]. This was later extended in December 2001 to include the marine reserve.

Noteworthy species include:
* [[Galápagos land iguanas]], ''[[Conolophus]]'' spp.
* [[Marine Iguana]], ''Amblyrhynchus cristatus'', the only iguana feeding in the sea
* [[Galápagos tortoise]] (Galápagos Giant [[tortoise]]), ''Geochelone elephantopus'', known as Galápago in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it gave the name to the islands
* [[Galápagos Green Turtle]], ''Chelonia mydas agassisi'', a subspecies of the [[Green Turtle]].
* [[Sea cucumber]]s, the cause of environmental battles with fishermen over [[Individual fishing quota|quota]]s of this expensive [[Asia]]n delicacy.
* [[Flightless Cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax harrisi''
* [[Great Frigatebird]] and [[Magnificent Frigatebird]]
* [[Blue-footed Booby]], ''Sula nebouxii'', popular among visitors for their large blue feet which they show off in courtship
* [[Galápagos Penguin]], ''Spheniscus mendiculus'', the only living tropical [[penguin]]
* [[Waved Albatross]], ''Phoebastria irrorata'', the only living tropical [[albatross]]
* [[Galápagos Hawk]], ''Buteo galapagoensis'', the islands' main [[scavenger]] and &quot;environmental police&quot;
* 4 [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species of [[Nesomimus|Galápagos mockingbirds]], the first species Darwin noticed to vary from island to island
* 13 endemic species of [[bunting]]s, popularly called [[Darwin's finches]]. Among them is the [[Sharp-beaked Ground-finch]] ''Geospiza difficilis septentrionalis'' which is sometimes called the &quot;Vampire Finch&quot; for its blood-sucking habits, and the tool-using [[Woodpecker Finch]], ''Camarhynchus pallidus''
* [[Galápagos Sea Lion]]s, ''Zalophus californianus'', closely related to the California Sea Lion, but smaller

===Environmental threats===
Introduced [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, such as feral goats, cats, and cattle, brought accidentally or willingly to the islands by humans, represent the main threat to Galápagos. Quick to reproduce, these alien species decimate the habitats of native species. The native animals, lacking natural predators on the islands, are defenseless to introduced species and fall prey.

Some of the most harmful introduced plants are the Guayaba or [[Guava]] ''Psidium guajava'', [[avocado]] ''Persea americana'', [[cascarilla]] ''Cinchona pubescens'', [[balsa]] ''Ochroma pyramidale'', [[blackberry]] ''Rubus glaucus'', various [[citrus]] ([[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[grapefruit]], [[lemon]]), [[floripondio]] ''Datura arborea'', [[higuerilla]] ''Ricinus communis'' and the [[elephant grass]] ''Pennisetum purpureum''. These plants have invaded large areas and eliminated endemic species in the humid zones of San Cristobal, Floreana, Isabela and Santa Cruz. Also, these harmful plants are just a few of introduced species on the Galapagos Islands. There are over 700 introduced plant species today. There are only 500 native and endemic species. This difference is creating a major problem for the islands and the natural species that inhabit them.

Many species were introduced to the Galápagos by [[pirate]]s. [[Thor Heyerdahl]] quotes documents that mention that the Viceroy of [[Peru]], knowing that British pirates ate the goats that they themselves had released in the islands, ordered dogs to be freed there to eliminate the goats. Also, when colonization of Floreana by José de Villamil failed, he ordered that the goats, donkeys, cows, and other animals from the farms in Floreana be transferred to other islands for the purpose of later colonization.

Non-native goats, pigs, dogs, rats, cats, mice, sheep, horses, donkeys, cows, poultry, ants, cockroaches, and some parasites inhabit the islands today. Dogs and cats attack the tame birds and destroy nests of birds, land tortoises, and marine turtles. They sometimes kill small Galápagos tortoises and iguanas. Pigs are even more harmful, covering larger areas and destroying the nests of tortoises, turtles and iguanas as well as eating the animals' native food. Pigs also knock down vegetation in their search for roots and insects. This problem abounds in Cerro Azul volcano and Isabela, and in Santiago pigs may be the cause of the disappearance of the land iguanas that were so abundant when Darwin visited. The black rat ''[[Rattus rattus]]'' attacks small Galápagos tortoises when they leave the nest, so that in Pinzón they stopped the reproduction for a period of more than 50&amp;nbsp;years; only adults were found on that island. Also, where the black rat is found, the endemic rat has disappeared. Cows and donkeys eat all the available vegetation and compete with native species for the scarce water. In 1959, fishermen introduced one male and two female goats to Pinta island; by 1973 the National Park service estimated the population of goats to be over 30,000 individuals. Goats were also introduced to Marchena in 1967 and to Rabida in 1971. However a recent goat eradication program has cleared most of the goat population from Isabela.

The fast growing poultry industry on the inhabited islands has been cause for concern from local conservationists, who fear that domestic birds could introduce disease into the endemic and wild bird populations.

[[Image:Tanker Jessica aground in Galapagos.jpg|thumb|right|The tanker ''Jessica'' aground in the Galapagos, January 2001]]
The Galápagos marine sanctuary is under threat from a host of illegal fishing activities, in addition to other problems of development. The most pressing threat to the Marine Reserve comes from local, mainland and foreign fishing targeting marine life illegally within the Reserve, such as sharks (hammerheads and other species) for their fins, and the harvest of sea cucumbers out of season. Development threatens both land and sea species. The growth of both the tourism industry and local populations fuelled by high birth rates and illegal immigration threaten the wildlife of the Archipelago. The recent grounding of the oil tanker ''Jessica'' and the subsequent oil spill brought this threat to world attention.

Currently, the rapidly growing problems, including tourism and a human population explosion, are further destroying habitats.

In 2007, [[UNESCO]] put the Galápagos Islands on their [[List of World Heritage Sites in danger|World Heritage in Danger]] List.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On January 28, 2008, [[Galapagos National Park]] official Victor Carrion announced the killing of 53 [[sea lions]] (13 [[pups]], 25 youngsters, 9 males and 6 females) at [[Pinta]], [[Galapagos]] Islands nature reserve with their heads caved in. In 2001 [[poachers]] killed 35 male sea lions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7214860.stm BBC NEWS, Sea lions massacred in Galapagos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galápagos Islands were short-listed as a candidate to be one of the [[New7Wonders of Nature]] by the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]] Foundation. As of February 2009 the archipelago was ranking first in Group B, the category for islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/ New 7 Wonders of the Word: Live Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
* In the movie ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' (2003), one of the main locations is the Galápagos Islands, where naturalist Stephen Maturin discovers new animal species.
* [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'' is an exploration of evolution and the absurdity of the human species, set in Guayaquil and the islands.
* [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[The Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles]]'' is a collection of ten short stories based on his own experiences on the South Seas. Melville knew the Islands firsthand, though he also relied on the stories of other sailors who had visited the Galápagos, as well as authorities such as [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s ''Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean'' (1822).
* In the [[Doctor Who]] audio drama [[Bloodtide]], the [[The Sixth Doctor]] ([[Colin Baker]]) and [[Evelyn Smythe]] ([[Maggie Stables]]), visit the Galapagos Islands, and meet Charles Darwin.

'''Sociocultural evolution(ism)''' is an umbrella term for theories of '''cultural evolution''' and [[social evolution]], describing how [[culture]]s and [[society|societies]] have developed over time. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between [[technology|technologies]], [[social structure]], the [[values]] of a [[society]], and how and why they change with time, they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of [[variation]] and [[social change]].

Most 19th century and some 20th century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of [[humankind]] as a whole, arguing that different societies are at different stages of [[social development]]. At present this thread is continued to some extent within the [[World systems theory|World System]] approach. Many of the more recent 20th-century approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea of directional change, or [[social progress]]. Most [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] work within the framework of modern theories of sociocultural evolution. Modern approaches to sociocultural evolution include [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], theory of modernization and [[theory of post-industrial society|theory of postindustrial society]].

==Introduction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]] often assume that human beings have natural [[social animal|social tendencies]] and that particular human [[social behavior]]s have non-[[genetics|genetic]] causes and dynamics (i.e. they are learned in a [[social environment]] and through [[social interaction]]). Societies exist in complex [[social environment|social]] (i.e. with natural resources and constraints) environments, and [[adaptation|adapt]] themselves to these environments. It is thus inevitable that all societies change.

Specific theories of social or cultural evolution are usually meant to explain differences between [[wikt:coeval|coeval]] societies, by positing that different societies are at different stages of development. Although such theories typically provide models for understanding the relationship between [[technology|technologies]], [[social structure]], or [[values]] of a [[society]], they vary as to the extent to which they describe specific mechanisms of variation and change.

Early sociocultural evolution theories&amp;mdash;the theories of [[Auguste Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]&amp;mdash;developed simultaneously but independently of [[Charles Darwin]]'s works and were popular from the late 19th century to the end of [[World War I]]. These 19th-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more ''civilized'' over time, and equated the [[culture]] and [[technology]] of [[western culture|Western civilization]] with progress. Some forms of early sociocultural evolution theories (mainly unilineal ones) have led to much criticised theories like [[social Darwinism]], and [[scientific racism]], used in the past to justify existing policies of [[colonialism]] and [[slavery]], and to justify new policies such as [[eugenics]].

Most 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a single entity. Most 20th-century approaches, such as [[multilineal evolution]], however, focused on changes specific to individual societies. Moreover, they rejected directional change (i.e. [[orthogenetic]], [[teleological]] or progressive change). Most [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] work within the framework of multilineal evolution. Other contemporary approaches to social change include [[neoevolutionism]], [[sociobiology]], [[dual inheritance theory]], [[theory of modernisation]] and [[theory of post-industrial society|theory of postindustrial society]].

==Classical social evolutionism==
=== Development ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}

==Organic society==
The 14th century [[Islamic]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] concluded that societies are living organisms that experience cyclic birth, growth, maturity, decline, and ultimately death due to universal causes several centuries before the [[western culture|Western civilisation]] developed the science of sociology. Nonetheless, theories of social and cultural evolution were common in modern [[European thought]]. Prior to the 18th century, Europeans predominantly believed that societies on Earth were in a state of decline. European society held up the world of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] as a standard to aspire to, and [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] produced levels of technical accomplishment which Europeans of the [[Middle Ages]] sought to emulate. At the same time, [[Christianity]] taught that people lived in a debased world fundamentally inferior to the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Heaven]]. During [[The Age of Enlightenment]], however, European self-confidence grew and the notion of progress became increasingly popular. It was during this period that what would later become known as &quot;sociological and cultural evolution&quot; would have its roots.

==Stadial theory==
The Enlightenment thinkers often speculated that societies progressed through stages of increasing development and looked for the [[logic]], order and the set of scientific truths that determined the course of [[human history]]. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], for example, argued that social development was an inevitable and determined process, similar to an acorn which has no choice but to become an oak tree. Likewise, it was assumed that societies start out primitive, perhaps in a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]], and naturally progress toward something resembling industrial Europe.

While earlier authors such as [[Michel de Montaigne]] discussed how societies change through time, it was truly the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] which proved key in the development of sociocultural evolution. After Scotland's [[Act of Union 1707|union]] with [[England]] in 1707, several Scottish thinkers pondered what the relationship between progress and the 'decadence' brought about by increased trade with England and the affluence it produced. The result was a series of &quot;[[conjectural history|conjectural histories]]&quot;. Authors such as [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Adam Smith]] argued that all societies pass through a series of four stages: hunting and gathering, pastoralism and nomadism, agricultural, and finally a stage of [[commerce]]. These thinkers thus understood the changes Scotland was undergoing as a transition from an agricultural to a [[mercantile]] society.
[[Image:Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]

Philosophical concepts of progress (such as those expounded by the German philosopher [[G.W.F. Hegel]]) developed as well during this period. In [[France]] authors such as [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] and other [[philosophe]]s were influenced by this Scottish tradition. Later thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Comte de Saint-Simon]] developed these ideas. [[Auguste Comte]] in particular presented a coherent view of social progress and a new discipline to study it&amp;mdash;[[sociology]]. The founders of sociology spent decades attempting to define their new discipline. In the course of this effort they tried several highly divergent pathways, some suggested by methods and contents of other sciences, others invented outright by the imagination of the scholar.

These developments took place in a wider context. The first process was [[colonialism]]. Although [[imperialism|imperial powers]] settled most differences of opinion with their colonial subjects with force, increased awareness of non-Western peoples raised new questions for European scholars about the nature of society and culture. Similarly, effective [[Public administration|administration]] required some degree of understanding of other cultures. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution allowed Europeans to organise their new knowledge in a way that reflected and justified their increasing political and economic domination of others: colonised people were less evolved, colonising people were more evolved. When the 17th-century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] described primeval man as living in conditions in which there are &quot;no arts, no letters, no society&quot; and his life as &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short&quot;, he was very much proclaiming a popular conception of the &quot;[[savage]].&quot; Everything that was good and civilized resulted from the slow development out of this lowly state. Even rationalistic philosophers like [[Voltaire]] implicitly assumed that enlightenment gradually resulted in the upward progress of humankind.

The second process was the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of [[capitalism]] which allowed and promoted continual revolutions in the [[means of production]]. Emerging theories of sociocultural evolution reflected a belief that the changes in Europe wrought by the Industrial Revolution and capitalism were improvements. Industrialisation, combined with the intense political change brought about by the [[French Revolution]] and the [[U.S. Constitution]], which were paving the way for the [[history of democracy|dominance of democracy]], forced European thinkers to reconsider some of their assumptions about how society was organised.

Eventually, in the 19th century three great classical theories of social and historical change were created: sociocultural evolutionism, the [[social cycle]] theory and [[Marxist]] [[historical materialism]]. Those theories had one common factor: they all agreed that the history of humanity is pursuing a certain fixed path, most likely that of [[social progress]]. Thus, each past event is not only chronologically, but causally tied to the present and future events. Those theories postulated that by recreating the sequence of those events, sociology could discover the [[history|laws of history]].

=== Sociocultural evolutionism and the idea of progress ===
{{main|Unilineal evolution}}
While sociocultural evolutionists agree that an evolution-like process leads to [[social progress]], classical social evolutionists have developed many different theories, known as theories of [[unilineal evolution]]. Sociocultural evolutionism was the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and [[social commentary]], and is associated with scholars like [[August Comte]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], [[Benjamin Kidd]], [[L.T. Hobhouse]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Sociocultural evolutionism represented an attempt to formalise social thinking along scientific lines, later influenced by the biological theory of [[evolution]]. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. They developed analogies between human society and the biological organism and introduced into sociological theory such biological concepts as [[variation]], [[natural selection]], and [[inheritance]]&amp;mdash;evolutionary factors resulting in the progress of societies through stages of savagery and barbarism to civilization, by virtue of the [[survival of the fittest]]. Together with the idea of progress there grew the notion of fixed &quot;stages&quot; through which human societies progress, usually numbering three&amp;mdash;savagery, barbarism, and civilization&amp;mdash;but sometimes many more. The [[Marquis de Condorcet]] listed 10 stages, or &quot;epochs&quot;, the final one having started with the French Revolution, which was destined, in his eyes, to usher in the rights of man and the perfection of the human race. Some writers also perceived in the growth stages of each individual a recapitulation of these stages of society. Strange customs were thus accounted for on the assumption that they were throwbacks to earlier useful practices. This also marked the beginning of [[anthropology]] as a scientific discipline and a departure from traditional religious views of &quot;primitive&quot; cultures.
[[Image:Herbert Spencer.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Herbert Spencer]]]]

The term &quot;Classical Social Evolutionism&quot; is most closely associated with the 19th-century writings of [[Auguste Comte]], [[Herbert Spencer]] (who coined the phrase &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;) and [[William Graham Sumner]]. In many ways Spencer's theory of &quot;[[cosmic evolution]]&quot; has much more in common with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and August Comte than with contemporary works of [[Charles Darwin]]. Spencer also developed and published his theories several years earlier than Darwin. In regard to social institutions, however, there is a good case that Spencer's writings might be classified as 'Social Evolutionism'. Although he wrote that societies over time progressed, and that progress was accomplished through competition, he stressed that the [[individual]] (rather than the [[collectivism|collectivity]]) is the unit of analysis that evolves, that evolution takes place through natural selection and that it affects social as well as biological phenomenon. Nonetheless, the publication of Darwin's works proved a boon to the proponents of sociocultural evolution. The world of social science took the ideas of biological evolution as an attractive solution to similar questions regarding the origins and development of social behaviour and the idea of a society as an evolving organism was a biological analogy that is taken up by many anthropologists and sociologists even today.

Both Spencer and Comte view the society as a kind of organism subject to the process of [[growth]]&amp;mdash;from simplicity to complexity, from chaos to order, from generalisation to specialisation, from flexibility to organisation. They agreed that the process of societies growth can be divided into certain stages, have their beginning and eventual end, and that this growth is in fact [[social progress]]&amp;mdash;each newer, more evolved society is better. Thus [[progressivism]] became one of the basic ideas underlying the theory of sociocultural evolutionism.

[[August Comte]], known as father of sociology, formulated the [[law of three stages]]: human development progresses from the [[theology|theological]] stage, in which nature was mythically conceived and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from supernatural beings, through [[metaphysics|metaphysical stage]] in which nature was conceived of as a result of obscure forces and man sought the explanation of natural phenomena from them until the final [[Positivism#Social Science|positive]] stage in which all abstract and obscure forces are discarded, and natural phenomena are explained by their constant relationship. This progress is forced through the development of human mind, and increasing application of thought, reasoning and logic to the understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://radicalacademy.com/adiphilpositivism.htm The Philosophy Of Positivism]&quot;. ''Adventures in Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Spencer, who believed that society was evolving toward increasing freedom for individuals; and so held that government intervention ought to be minimal in social and political life, differentiated between two phases of development, focusing on the type of internal regulation within societies. Thus he differentiated between [[military]] and [[industry|industrial]] societies. The earlier, more primitive military society has a goal of conquest and [[defense (military)|defence]], is [[centralisation|centralised]], [[economy|economically]] self-sufficient, [[collective|collectivistic]], puts the good of a group over the good of an individual, uses compulsion, force and repression, rewards loyalty, obedience and discipline. The industrial society has a goal of [[Manufacturing|production]] and [[trade]], is [[decentralisation|decentralised]], interconnected with other societies via economic relations, achieves its goals through voluntary cooperation and individual self-restraint, treats the good of individual as the highest value, regulates the social life via voluntary relations, values initiative, independence and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bolender.com/Dr.%20Ron/SOC4044%20Sociological%20Theory/Class%20Sessions/Sociological%20Theory/Spencer,%20Herbert/spencer,_herbert.htm Herbert Spencer]&quot;. ''Sociological Theorists Page''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how scholars of Spencer interpret his relation to Darwin, Spencer proved to be an incredibly popular figure in the 1870s, particularly in the [[United States]]. Authors such as [[Edward L. Youmans]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[John Fiske]], [[John W. Burgess]], [[Lester Frank Ward]], [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and other thinkers of the [[gilded age]] all developed similar theories of social evolutionism as a result of their exposure to Spencer as well as Darwin.
[[Image:Morgan.jpg|left|frame|[[Lewis H. Morgan]]]]

[[Lewis H. Morgan]], an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] whose ideas have had much impact on sociology, in his 1877 classic ''Ancient Societies'' differentiated between three eras: [[savagery]], [[barbarism]] and [[civilization]], which are divided by technological inventions, like fire, [[bow (weapon)|bow]], [[pottery]] in the savage era, [[domestication of animals]], [[agriculture]], [[metalworking]] in the barbarian era and [[alphabet]] and [[writing]] in the civilization era. Thus Morgan introduced a link between [[social progress]] and [[technological progress]]. Morgan viewed technological progress as a force behind social progress, and any [[social change]]&amp;mdash;in [[social institution]]s, organisations or ideologies have their beginning in technological change.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Lewis H.(1877) &quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/morgan-lewis/ancient-society/ch03.htm Chapter III: Ratio of Human Progress]&quot;. ''Ancient Society.''&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's theories were popularised by [[Friedrich Engels]], who based his famous work ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' on it. For Engels and other [[Marxist]]s, this theory was important as it supported their conviction that materialistic factors&amp;mdash;economic and technological&amp;mdash;are decisive in shaping the fate of humanity.

[[Emile Durkheim]], another of the &quot;fathers&quot; of sociology, developed a similar, [[dichotomy|dichotomal]] view of social progress. His key concept was [[social solidarity]], as he defined social evolution in terms of progressing from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]]. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], second on increasing &quot;morality density&quot; (development of more complex [[social interaction]]s) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. To Durkheim, the most important factor in the social progress is the [[division of labour]].
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Emile Durkheim]]]]

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Sir E.B. Tylor]] in England and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in the United States worked with data from [[indigenous people]], whom they claimed represented earlier stages of cultural evolution that gave insight into the process and progression of evolution of culture. Morgan would later have a significant influence on [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who developed a theory of sociocultural evolution in which the internal contradictions in society created a series of escalating stages that ended in a socialist society (see [[Marxism]]). Tylor and Morgan elaborated the theory of unilinear evolution, specifying criteria for categorising cultures according to their standing within a fixed system of growth of humanity as a whole and examining the modes and mechanisms of this growth. Theirs was often a concern with culture in general, not with individual cultures.

Their analysis of cross-cultural data was based on three assumptions:
# contemporary societies may be classified and ranked as more &quot;primitive&quot; or more &quot;civilized&quot;;
# There are a determinate number of stages between &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; (e.g. [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], and [[Sovereign state|state]]),
# All societies progress through these stages in the same sequence, but at different rates.
Theorists usually measured progression (that is, the difference between one stage and the next) in terms of increasing social complexity (including class differentiation and a complex division of labour), or an increase in intellectual, theological, and aesthetic sophistication. These 19th-century [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] used these principles primarily to explain differences in religious beliefs and kinship terminologies among various societies.

[[Lester Frank Ward]] developed Spencer's theory but unlike Spencer, who considered evolution to be general process applicable to the entire world, physical and sociological, Ward differentiated sociological evolution from biological evolution. He stressed that humans create goals for themselves and strive to realise them, whereas there is no such intelligence and awareness guiding the non-human world, which develops more or less at random. He created a hierarchy of evolution processes. First, there is [[cosmogenesis]], creation and evolution of the world. Then, after life develops, there is [[biogenesis]]. Development of humanity leads to [[anthropogenesis]], which is influenced by the [[human mind]]. Finally, when [[society]] develops, so does [[sociogenesis]], which is the science of shaping the society to fit with various political, cultural and ideological goals.
[[Image:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Edward Burnett Tylor]]]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]], pioneer of [[anthropology]], focused on the [[evolution of culture]] worldwide, noting that culture is an important part of every society and that it is also subject to the process of evolution. He believed that societies were at different stages of cultural development and that the purpose of anthropology was to reconstruct the evolution of culture, from primitive beginnings to the modern state.

[[Ferdinand Tönnies]] describes evolution as the development from informal society, where people have many liberties and there are few laws and obligations, to modern, formal rational society, dominated by traditions and laws and people are restricted from acting as they wish. He also notes that there is a tendency of [[standardisation]] and [[unification]], when all smaller societies are absorbed into a single, large, modern society. Thus Tönnies can be said to describe part of the process known today as [[globalization]]. Tönnies was also one of the first sociologists to claim that the evolution of society is not necessarily going in the right direction, that [[social progress]] is not perfect, and it can even be called a [[regression]] as the newer, more evolved societies are obtained only after paying a high cost, resulting in decreasing satisfaction of individuals making up that society. Tönnies' work became the foundation of [[neoevolutionism]].

Although not usually counted as a sociocultural evolutionist, [[Max Weber]]'s theory of [[tripartite classification of authority]] can be viewed as an evolutionary theory as well. Weber distinguishes three [[ideal type]]s of political [[leadership]], [[domination]] and [[authority]]: [[charismatic domination]] (familial and religious), [[traditional domination]] (patriarchs, patrimonalism, feudalism) and [[legal domination|legal (rational) domination]] (modern law and state, bureaucracy). He also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones.

===Critique and impact on modern theories===
&lt;!--[[Image:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Franz Boas]] removed image due to fair use problems raised during FAC process, please reinstert if fixed--&gt;
The early 20th century inaugurated a period of systematic critical examination, and rejection of the sweeping generalisations of the unilineal theories of sociocultural evolution. [[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologists]] such as [[Franz Boas]], along with his students, including [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]], are regarded as the leaders of anthropology's rejection of classical social evolutionism.  They used sophisticated [[ethnography]] and more rigorous empirical methods to argue that Spencer, Tylor, and Morgan's theories were speculative and systematically misrepresented ethnographic data. Theories regarding &quot;stages&quot; of evolution were especially criticised as illusions. Additionally, they rejected the distinction between &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; (or &quot;modern&quot;), pointing out that so-called primitive contemporary societies have just as much history, and were just as evolved, as so-called civilized societies. They therefore argued that any attempt to use this theory to reconstruct the histories of non-literate (i.e. leaving no historical documents) peoples is entirely speculative and unscientific. They observed that the postulated progression, which typically ended with a stage of civilization identical to that of modern Europe, is [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. They also pointed out that the theory assumes that societies are clearly bounded and distinct, when in fact cultural traits and forms often cross social boundaries and diffuse among many different societies (and is thus an important mechanism of change). Boas introduced the [[culture history]] approach, which concentrated on fieldwork among native peoples to identify actual cultural and historical processes rather than speculative stages of growth. This &quot;culture history&quot; approach dominated American anthropology for the first half of the 20th century and so influenced anthropology elsewhere that high-level generalization and &quot;systems building&quot; became far less common than in the past.

Later critics observed that this assumption of firmly bounded societies was proposed precisely at the time when European powers were colonising non-Western societies, and was thus self-serving. Many anthropologists and social theorists now consider unilineal cultural and social evolution a Western [[mythology|myth]] seldom based on solid empirical grounds. Critical theorists argue that notions of social evolution are simply justifications for [[power (sociology)|power]] by the elites of society. Finally, the devastating World Wars that occurred between 1914 and 1945 crippled Europe's self-confidence. After millions of deaths, genocide, and the destruction of Europe's industrial infrastructure, the idea of progress seemed dubious at best.

Thus modern sociocultural evolutionism rejects most of classical social evolutionism due to various theoretical problems:
# The theory was deeply [[ethnocentric]]&amp;mdash;it makes heavy value judgements on different societies; with [[western culture|Western civilization]] seen as the most valuable.
# It assumed all cultures follow the same path or progression and have the same goals.
# It equated [[civilization]] with [[material culture]] (technology, cities, etc.)
# It equated [[evolution]] with progress or ''[[survival of the fittest|fitness]],'' based on deep misunderstandings of [[evolutionary theory]]{{Fact|date=September 2008}}.

Because social evolution was posited as a scientific theory, it was often used to support unjust and often [[racist]] social practices&amp;mdash;particularly [[colonialism]], [[slavery]], and the unequal economic conditions present within industrialized Europe. [[Social Darwinism]] is especially criticised, as it led to some philosophies used by the [[Nazis]]..

{{main|multilineal evolution}}
[[Image:Earthlights dmsp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Composite image of the Earth at night, created by [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]]. The brightest areas of the Earth are the most urbanized, but not necessarily the most populated. Even more than 100 years after the invention of the electric light, most regions remain thinly populated or unlit.]]
When the critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches changed respectively . Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgements; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as [[cultural relativism]] and [[multilineal evolution]].

In 1941 anthropologist [[Robert Redfield]] wrote about a shift from 'folk society' to 'urban society'. By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as [[neoevolutionism]]. White rejected the opposition between &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation ([[White's law]]). Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of &quot;adaptation&quot;, arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way.

The anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Elman Service]] prepared an edited volume, ''Evolution and Culture'', in which they attempted to synthesise White's and Steward's approaches.&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution and culture''. Ed. by Marshall David Sahlins and Elman Service. Ann Arbor, MI: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are [[Peter Vayda]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Sidney Mintz]] turned away from cultural ecology to [[Marxism]], [[World Systems Theory]], [[Dependency theory]] and [[Marvin Harris]]'s [[Cultural materialism]].

Today most anthropologists reject 19th-century notions of progress and the three assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and argue that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. There are still others who continue to reject the entirety of the evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. As a result, the simplistic notion of &quot;cultural evolution&quot; has grown less useful and given way to an entire series of more nuanced approaches to the relationship of culture and environment. In the area of development studies, authors such as [[Amartya Sen]] have developed an understanding of &quot;development&quot; and 'human flourishing' that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.

==== Neoevolutionism ====
{{main|Neoevolutionism}}

Neoevolutionism was the first in a series of modern multilineal evolution theories. It emerged in the 1930s and extensively developed in the period following the [[Second World War]] and was incorporated into both [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] in the 1960s. It bases its theories on empirical evidence from areas of [[archaeology]], [[palaeontology]] and [[historiography]] and tries to eliminate any references to systems of [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, be it moral or cultural, instead trying to remain objective and simply descriptive.

While 19th-century evolutionism explained how culture develops by giving general principles of its evolutionary process, it was dismissed by the [[Historical particularism|Historical Particularists]] as unscientific in the early 20th century. It was the neoevolutionary thinkers who brought back evolutionary thought and developed it to be acceptable to contemporary anthropology.

Neoevolutionism discards many ideas of classical social evolutionism, namely that of [[social progress]], so dominant in previous sociology evolution-related theories. Then neoevolutionism discards the [[determinism]] argument and introduces [[probability]], arguing that accidents and free will greatly affect the process of social evolution. It also supports [[counterfactual history]]&amp;mdash;asking &quot;what if&quot; and considering different possible paths that social evolution may take or might have taken, and thus allows for the fact that various cultures may develop in different ways, some skipping entire stages others have passed through. Neoevolutionism stresses the importance of [[empirical]] evidence. While 19th-century evolutionism used value judgments and assumptions for interpreting data, neoevolutionism relied on measurable information for analysing the process of sociocultural evolution.

[[Leslie White]], author of ''The Evolution of Culture: The Development of Civilization to the Fall of Rome'' (1959), attempted to create a theory explaining the entire history of humanity. The most important factor in his theory is [[technology]]: ''[[Social system]]s are determined by technological systems'', wrote White in his book,&lt;ref&gt;''The Evolution of Culture'', Leslie White&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the earlier theory of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. He proposes a society's [[energy consumption]] as a measure of its advancement. He differentiates between five stages of human development. In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants (so White refers to [[agricultural revolution]] here). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula, P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of efficiency of technical factors utilising the energy. This theory is similar to Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Kardashev]]'s later theory of the [[Kardashev scale]].

[[Julian Steward]], author of ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' (1955, reprinted 1979), created the theory of &quot;multilinear&quot; evolution which examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than White's theory of &quot;unilinear evolution.&quot; Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of &quot;adaptation&quot;, arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited, the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources, and the organization of human labour. He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations, and that as the resource base or technology changed, so too would a culture. In other words, cultures do not change according to some inner logic, but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment. Cultures therefore would not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed&amp;mdash;rather, they would change in varying ways and directions. He called his theory &quot;multilineal evolution&quot;. He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory encompassing the entire evolution of humanity; however, he argued that anthropologists are not limited to describing specific existing cultures. He believed that it is possible to create theories analysing typical common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of given culture he pointed to technology and economics, but noted that there are secondary factors, like political system, ideologies and religion. All those factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time; hence the application of the term &quot;multilinear&quot; to his theory of evolution.

[[Marshall Sahlins]], co-editor with Elman Service of ''Evolution and Culture'' (1960), divided the evolution of societies into 'general' and 'specific'. General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a [[Diffusionism|diffusion]] of their qualities (like technological [[invention]]s). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and at different stages of evolution.

In his ''Power and Prestige'' (1966) and ''Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology'' (1974), [[Gerhard Lenski]]  expands on the works of [[Leslie White]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. He views [[technological progress]] as the most basic factor in the evolution of societies and cultures. Unlike White, who defined technology as the ability to create and utilise [[energy]], Lenski focuses on [[information]]&amp;mdash;its amount and uses. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He distinguishes four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through by experience. In the third, humans start using [[signs]] and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s and develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in the technology of communication translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], distribution of [[goods]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication and economy: (1) hunters and gatherers, (2) simple agricultural, (3) advanced agricultural, (4) industrial, and (5) special (like fishing societies).

[[Talcott Parsons]], author of ''Societies: Evolutionary and Comparative Perspectives'' (1966) and ''The System of Modern Societies'' (1971) divided evolution into four subprocesses: (1) division, which creates functional subsystems from the main system; (2) adaptation, where those systems evolve into more efficient versions; (3) inclusion of elements previously excluded from the given systems; and (4) generalization of values, increasing the legitimization of the ever more complex system. He shows those processes on 4 stages of evolution: (I) primitive or foraging, (II) archaic agricultural, (III) classical or &quot;historic&quot; in his terminology, using formalized and universalizing theories about reality and (IV) modern empirical cultures.

==== Sociobiology ====
{{main|Sociobiology}}

[[Sociobiology]] departs perhaps the furthest from classical social evolutionism. It was introduced by [[Edward Osborne Wilson|Edward Wilson]] in his 1975 book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' and followed his adaptation of evolutionary theory to the field of social sciences. Wilson pioneered the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviours such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance. In doing so, Wilson sparked one of the greatest scientific [[controversy|controversies]] of the 20th century.

Sociobiologists have argued for a [[dual inheritance theory]], which posits that humans are products of both biological evolution and sociocultural evolution, each subject to their own selective mechanisms and forms of transmission (i.e. in the case of biology, [[genes]], and cultural evolutionary units are often called [[memes]]). This approach focuses on both the mechanisms of cultural transmission and the selective pressures that influence cultural change. This version of sociocultural evolution shares little in common with the stadial evolutionary models of the early and mid-20th century. This approach has been embraced by many [[Psychology|psychologists]] and some [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], but very few [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologists]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

The current theory of evolution, the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], explains that [[evolution]] of [[species]] occurs through a combination of Darwin's mechanism of [[natural selection]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[genetics]] as the basis for biological inheritance and mathematical [[population genetics]]. Essentially, the modern synthesis introduced the connection between two important discoveries; the units of evolution ([[gene]]s) with the main mechanism of evolution ([[natural selection|selection]]).

Due to its close reliance on biology, sociobiology is often considered a branch of the biology and sociology disciplines, although it uses techniques from a plethora of sciences, including [[ethology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], [[population genetics]], and many others. Within the study of human [[societies]], sociobiology is closely related to the fields of [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology has remained highly controversial as it contends [[genes]] explain specific human behaviours, although sociobiologists describe this role as a very complex and often unpredictable interaction between nature and nurture. The most notable critics of the view that genes play a direct role in human behaviour have been biologists [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

Since the rise of [[Evolutionary psychology]], another school of thought has emerged in the past 25 years that applies the mathematical standards of 
[[Population genetics]] to modeling the adaptive and selective principles of culture. This school of thought was pioneered by [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and Peter Richerson at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] and expanded by [[William Wimsatt]], among others. Boyd and Richerson's book
&quot;Culture and the Evolutionary Process&quot; (1985)[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/240.ctl] was a highly mathematical description of cultural change, later published in a more accessible form in &quot;Not by Genes Alone&quot; (2004)  [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16460.ctl]. In Boyd and Richerson's view, cultural evolution exists on a separate ground from biological evolution, and while the two are related, cultural evolution is more dynamic, rapid, and influential on human society than biological evolution.

==== Theory of modernization ====
{{main|Modernization theory}}
Theories of [[modernization]] have been developed and popularized in 1950s and 1960s and are closely related to the [[dependency theory]] and [[development theory]]. It combines the previous theories of sociocultural evolution with practical experiences and empirical research, especially those from the era of [[decolonization]]. The theory states that:
* Western countries are the most developed, and rest of the world (mostly former colonies) are on the earlier stages of development, and will eventually reach the same level as the Western world.
* Development stages go from the traditional societies to developed ones.
* [[Third World]] countries have fallen behind with their [[social progress]] and need to be directed on their way to becoming more advanced.
Developing from classical social evolutionism theories, theory of modernization stresses the modernization factor: many societies are simply trying (or need to) emulate the most successful societies and cultures. It also states that it is possible to do so, thus supporting the concepts of [[social engineering]] and that the developed countries can and should help those less developed, directly or indirectly.

Among the scientists who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernization, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernization in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernization. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernization cannot happen until given society values innovation, success and free enterprise. [[Alex Inkeles]] (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. Some works of [[Jürgen Habermas]] are also connected with this subfield.

Theory of modernization has been subject to some criticism similar to that levied on classical social evolutionism, especially for being too [[ethnocentric]], one-sided and focused on the Western world and culture.

====Prediction for a stable cultural and social future====
Cultural evolution follows [[punctuated equilibrium]] which Gould and Eldredge developed for biological evolution. Bloomfield&lt;ref&gt; Bloomfield, Masse.''Mankind in Transitio'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Bloomfield, Masse.''The Automated Societ'', Masefield Books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; has written that human societies follow punctuated equilibrium which would mean first, a stable society, a transition resulting in a subsequent stable society with greater complexity.  Using these guidelines, mankind has had a stable animal society, a transition to a stable tribal society, another transition to a stable peasant society and is currently in a transitional industrial society.

The status of a human society rests on the [[productivity]] of food production.  [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Deevey]]&lt;ref&gt; Deevey, E. S., [[The Human Population]], Scientific American 203, September 1960, p.226. &lt;/ref&gt; reported on the growth of the number of humans.  Deevey also reported on the productivity of food production, noting that productivity changes very little for stable societies, but increases during transitions.  When productivity and especially food productivity can no longer be increased, Bloomfield has proposed that man will have achieved a stable automated society (see also, e.g., [[Korotayev]] et al. 2006). Space is also assumed to allow for the continued growth of the human population, as well as provide a solution to the current pollution problem by providing limitless energy from solar satellite power stations.

==== Theory of postindustrial society ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
{{main|Theory of postindustrial society}}
Scientists have used the theory of evolution to analyze various trends and to predict the future development of societies. These scientists have created the theories of [[post-industrial society|postindustrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|service]]s and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]].

&lt;!--[[Image:Danielbell.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Daniel Bell]] removed image due to unknown copyright status, please reinstert if fixed--&gt;
In 1974, sociologist [[Daniel Bell]], author of ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', introduced the concept of [[postindustrial society]]. He divided the history of humanity into three eras: pre-industrial, industrial and postindustrial. He predicted that by the end of the 20th century, United States, Japan and Western Europe would reach the postindustrial stage. This &quot;post-industrial&quot; stage would be demonstrated by:
* domination of the [[service sector]] (administration, banking, trade, transport, healthcare, education, science, mass media, culture) over the traditional [[industry sector]] (manufacturing industries, which have surpassed the more traditional, [[agriculture sector|agriculture and mining sector]] after the 19th-century [[Industrial Revolution]]);
* growing importance of [[information technology|information technologies]];
* increased role of long-term planning, modelling future trends;
* domination of [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[pragmatism]] over traditional [[ethic]]s and [[ideology|ideologies]];
* increasing importance and use of technology and intellect;
* changes in the traditional hierarchy of [[social class]]es, with highly educated specialists and scientists overtaking the traditional [[bourgeois]];

From the 1970s many other sociologists and anthropologists, like [[Alvin Toffler]] (''[[Future Shock]]'', 1970), and [[John Naisbitt]] (''Megatrends 2000: The New Directions for the 1990s'', 1982) have followed in Bell's footsteps and created similar theories. John Naisbitt introduced the concept of megatrends: powerful, global trends that are changing societies on the worldwide scale. Among the megatrends that he mentions was the process of [[globalization]]. Another important megatrend was the increase in performance of computers and the development of the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] introduced the concept of the [[global village (Internet)|global village]] (''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'', 1962), and this term was soon adapted by the researchers of globalization and the [[Internet]]. Naisbitt and many other proponents of the theory of postindustrial societies argues that those megatrends lead to [[decentralization]], weakening of the [[central government]], increasing importance of local initiatives and [[direct democracy]], changes in the hierarchy of the traditional social classes, development of new [[social movement]]s and increased powers of consumers and number of choices available to them (Toffler even used the term &quot;overchoice&quot;).
[[Image:PPTCountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Logarithm]]ic plot, according to [[Ray Kurzweil]] showing an [[exponential decay|exponential]] shortening trend in evolution of humanity, basis for the [[technological singularity]] theory.]]

&lt;!--[[Image:Alvin toffler.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alvin Toffler]] removed image due to fair use problems raised during FAC process, please reinstert if fixed--&gt;
Some of the more extreme visions of the postindustrial society are those related to the theory of the [[technological singularity]]. This theory refers to a [[prediction|predicted]] point or period in the development of a civilization at which due to the acceleration of [[technological progress]], the societal, scientific and economic change is so rapid that nothing beyond that time can be reliably comprehended, understood or predicted by the pre-Singularity humans. Such a singularity was first discussed in the 1950s, and vastly popularized in the 1980s by [[Vernor Vinge]].

Critics of the postindustrial society theory point out that it is very vague and as any prediction, there is no guarantee that any of the trends visible today will in fact exist in the future or develop in the directions predicted by contemporary researchers. However, no serious sociologist would argue it is possible to predict the future, but only that such theories allow us to gain a better understanding of the changes taking place in the modernised world.

==Contemporary discourse over sociocultural evolution==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
The [[Cold War]] period was marked by rivalry between two superpowers, both of which considered themselves to be the most highly evolved cultures on the planet. The [[USSR]] painted itself as a [[socialism|socialist]] society which emerged out of [[class struggle]], destined to reach the state of [[communism]], while sociologists in the United States (such as [[Talcott Parsons]]) argued that the freedom and prosperity of the [[United States]] were a proof of a higher level of sociocultural evolution of its culture and society. At the same time, [[decolonization]] created newly independent countries who sought to become more developed&amp;mdash;a model of progress and industrialization which was itself a form of sociocultural evolution.

There is, however, a tradition in European [[social theory]] from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] to [[Max Weber]] that argues that this progression coincides with a loss of human freedom and dignity. At the height of the Cold War, this tradition merged with an interest in [[ecology]] to influence an [[activist]] culture in the 1960s. This movement produced a variety of political and philosophical programs which emphasised the importance of bringing society and the environment into harmony. Current political theories of the [[new tribalists]] consciously mimic ecology and the life-ways of [[indigenous peoples]], augmenting them with modern sciences. [[Ecoregional Democracy]] attempts to confine the &quot;shifting groups&quot;, or [[tribe]]s, within &quot;more or less clear boundaries&quot; that a society inherits from the surrounding [[ecology]], to the borders of a naturally occurring [[ecoregion]]. Progress can proceed by competition between but not within tribes, and it is limited by ecological borders or by [[Natural Capitalism]] incentives which attempt to mimic the pressure of [[natural selection]] on a human society by forcing it to adapt consciously to scarce energy or materials. [[Gaians]] argue that societies evolve deterministically to play a role in the ecology of their [[biosphere]], or else die off as failures due to competition from more efficient societies exploiting nature's leverage.

Thus, some have appealed to theories of sociocultural evolution to assert that optimising the ecology and the social harmony of closely knit groups is more desirable or necessary than the progression to &quot;civilization.&quot; A 2002 poll of experts on [[Nearctic]] and [[Neotropic]] [[indigenous peoples]] (reported in ''Harper's'' magazine) revealed that ''all of them'' would have preferred to be a typical New World person in the year 1491, prior to any European contact, rather than a typical European of that time.

This approach has been criticised by pointing out that there are a number of historical examples of indigenous peoples doing severe environmental damage (such as the [[deforestation]] of [[Easter Island]] and the extinction of [[mammoth]]s in North America) and that proponents of the goal have been trapped by the European stereotype of the [[noble savage]].

Today, [[postmodernists]] question whether the notions of evolution or society have inherent meaning and whether they reveal more about the person doing the description than the thing being described. Observing and observed cultures may lack sufficient cultural similarities (such as a common [[foundation ontology]]) to be able to communicate their respective priorities easily. Or, one may impose such a system of belief and judgment upon another, via [[Right of conquest|conquest]] or [[colonization]]. For instance, observation of very different ideas of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] in [[indigenous peoples]] led indirectly to ideas such as [[George Lakoff]]'s &quot;[[cognitive science of mathematics]]&quot;, which asks if measurement systems themselves can be objective.

&lt;!-- not relevant here!! The '''theory of transmutation''' had early origins in the speculations and hypotheses of [[Erasmus Darwin]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin, postulated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Would it be too bold to imagine that, in the great length of time since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great [[First Cause]] endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions and associations, and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effects on society==--&gt;
The '''social effects of evolutionary thought''' have been considerable.  As the scientific explanation of life's diversity has developed, it has often displaced alternative, sometimes very widely held, explanations. Because the theory of [[evolution]] includes an explanation of humanity's origins, it has had a profound impact on human [[society|societies]]. Some have vigorously opposed acceptance of the scientific explanation due to its perceived religious implications (e.g. its implied rejection of the [[special creation]] of humans described in the [[Bible]]). This has led to a vigorous conflict between [[creation and evolution in public education]], primarily in the United States.

==Evolution and ethics==
The theory of evolution by natural selection has also been adopted as a foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as [[social Darwinism]], an idea which preceded the publication of &lt;cite&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/cite&gt;, popular in the 19th century which holds that &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot; (a phrase coined in 1851 by Herbert Spencer, 6 years before Darwin published his theory of evolution) explains and justifies differences in wealth and success among societies and people. A similar interpretation was one created by Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], known as [[eugenics]], which claimed that human civilization was subverting natural selection by allowing the &quot;less fit&quot; to survive and &quot;out-breed&quot; the &quot;more fit.&quot; Later advocates of this theory would suggest radical and often coercive social measures to attempt to &quot;correct&quot; this imbalance. [[Thomas Huxley]] spent much time demonstrating through a series of thought experiments that it would not only be immoral, but impossible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2940 Eugenics, etc]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that social Darwinism is based on misconceptions of evolutionary theory, and many ethicists regard it as a case of the [[is-ought problem]]. After the atrocities of [[the Holocaust]] became linked with eugenics, it greatly fell out of favor with public and scientific opinion, though it was never universally accepted by either, and at no point in Nazi literature is Charles Darwin or the scientific theory of evolution mentioned. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm The fallacious nature of [[reductio ad Hitlerum]] arguments by anti-evolutionists.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Darwin himself addressed eugenic concepts and denounced them as &quot;evil&quot; in his book, &lt;cite&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/cite&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless; it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.&lt;br&gt;
- Charles Darwin; &lt;cite&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/cite&gt;, 1871
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Neo-Creationism|Neo-creationist]] [[Polemics]] single out &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot; as the cause of many, if not all, of modern society's ills. In the controversial book &lt;cite&gt;From Darwin to Hitler&lt;/cite&gt; by Richard Weikart [http://www.darwintohitler.com/], Weikart claims that Darwinism's impact on ethics and morality played a key role not only in the rise of [[eugenics]], but also in [[euthanasia]], [[infanticide]], [[abortion]], and racial extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis. Many critics contend this. 

In his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] argues that Nazism was largely a continuation of [[Christian anti-Semitism]]. Jim Walker has compiled a list of 129 quotes from [[Mein Kampf]] in which Hitler described himself as a Christian or mentioned God or Jesus or a biblical passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler.htm Webpage containing 129 Mein Kampf quotes relating to his Christianity]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that 6 million of the people killed during the Holocaust were killed because of their religion (Judaism) not their race or &quot;strength&quot; or any reason which has an obvious link to the mechanism of Darwinian evolution. Hitler often used Christian beliefs like &quot;Jews killed Jesus&quot; amongst other things to justify his anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitlerchristian.htm Religion and Hitler - a history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research for Weikart's book was funded by the [[Discovery Institute]], which has been very active in promoting [[intelligent design]] as an alternative to evolution in public school science classrooms, and whose &quot;[[Wedge strategy|Wedge document]]&quot; and former mission statement expand on the theme: &quot;The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating. Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs.&quot; ... &quot;materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.&quot; {{waybackdate|site=http://www.discovery.org/crsc/aboutcrsc.html|date=19970608130849}}

The notion that humans share ancestors with other animals has also affected how some people view the relationship between humans and other species. Many proponents of [[animal rights]] hold that if animals and humans are of the same nature, then rights cannot be distinct to humans.

Charles Darwin himself was an abolitionist who argued that sympathy was not only one of the most important moral values, but that sympathy was indeed a product of natural selection and was a trait that was beneficial to social animals, such as humans. Darwin argued that the societies with the most sympathetic people would be the most successful. He also stated that our sympathy should be extended to &quot;all sentient beings&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shows us how long it is, before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. ... This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honored and practiced by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion.&lt;br&gt;

===Thomas Huxley: Evolution and Ethics===
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}
[[Thomas Huxley]], &quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;, spent much of his book [[Evolution and Ethics]] debunking Social Darwinism, piece by piece. The following is a summary of his arguments in the &quot;Prolegomena&quot;, the most detailed and comprehensive of the two sections devoted to it. It should be noted that Huxley is here attempting to disprove the science behind Social Darwinism; as such, the moral arguments only come in later in the essay.

Consider a garden. Without constant upkeep, it would return to the &quot;state of nature&quot;, even the very walls surrounding it crumbling in sufficient time, but by constant diligence of the gardener, may be maintained in a &quot;state of art&quot;. This &quot;state of art&quot; is not permanent: It is instead the replacement of natural selection by artificial selection through the human energy expended in maintaining it.

This artificial selection is, however, part of natural selection: It is the action upon a set of species by the human species by way of the human species expending energy through evolved intelligence on its choice of selection. It is thus no less natural than, for example, a predator expending energy through evolved instinct on preferentially hunting a certain prey species. The presence of humans may change the dynamic, but in a perfectly natural way. Hence, it is part of the &quot;cosmic process&quot;, that is natural laws, even though the &quot;histological process&quot; may remove many aspects of the &quot;struggle for existence&quot; which is a key part of the natural laws as apply to biology, from its preferred plant species by substituting human work for work done by the species itself.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is the state of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the principle of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of that struggle, by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions to the needs of the forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nature uses unrestricted breeding to let hundreds compete for the natural resources that would only support one, and uses frost and drought to kill off the weak and unlucky, requiring not just strength, but &quot;flexibility and good fortune.&quot; However, a gardener &quot;restricts multiplication; provides that each plant shall have sufficient space and nourishment; protects from frost and drought; and, in every other way, attempts to modify the conditions, in such a manner as to bring about the survival of those forms which most nearly approach the standard of the useful or the beautiful, which he has in his mind&quot;, limited only by climate and other such natural conditions. However, although natural selection may have been stopped by the gardener's actions, he is still capable of improvement of the species, should he find them wanting, through selective breeding. The struggle for existence is not actually required for improvement: only heritability, variation, and some form of selective pressure.

Can we then apply this to humans? Let's see how far we can take the analogy with respect to colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose a shipload of English colonists sent to form a settlement, in such a country as Tasmania was in the middle of the last century. On landing, they find themselves in the midst of a state of nature, widely different from that left behind them in everything but the most general physical conditions. The common plants, the common birds and quadrupeds, are as totally distinct as the men from anything to be seen on the side of the globe from which they come. The colonists proceed to put an end to this state of things over as large an area as they desire to occupy.  They clear away the native vegetation, extirpate or drive out the animal population, so far as may be necessary, and take measures to defend themselves from the re-immigration of either. In their place, they introduce English grain and fruit trees; English dogs, sheep, cattle, horses; and English men; in fact, they set up a new Flora and Fauna and a new variety of mankind, within the old state of nature. Their farms and pastures represent a garden on a great scale, and themselves the gardeners who have to keep it up, in watchful antagonism to the old regime. Considered as a whole, the colony is a composite unit introduced into the old state of nature; and, thenceforward, a competitor in the struggle for existence, to conquer or be vanquished.
&lt;p&gt;
Under the conditions supposed, there is no doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as yet we lack an organized gardener. Let us imagine an idealized one: an administrative authority of intelligence and foresight as much greater than men as men are to their livestock. The unwanted native species - men, animals, or plants - are all weeded out and destroyed. Those to replace them are chosen with a view to his ideal of the colony, just as a gardener tries to create through his selection his ideal garden. And, finally, to ensure that no struggle for existence between the colonists interferes with the struggle against nature, he provides them with sufficient food, housing, and so on. &quot;With every step of this progress in civilization, the colonists would become more and more independent of the state of nature; more and more, their lives would be conditioned by a state of art. In order to attain his ends, the administrator would have to avail himself of the courage, industry, and co-operative intelligence of the settlers; and it is plain that the interest of the community would be best served by increasing the proportion of persons who possess such qualities, and diminishing that of persons devoid of them. In other words, by selection directed towards an ideal.&quot;

However, though this might create a paradise where every aspect of nature works to support its colonists, problems arise: &quot;as soon as the colonists began to multiply, the administrator would have to face the tendency to the reintroduction of the cosmic struggle into his artificial fabric, in consequence of the competition, not merely for the commodities, but for the means of existence. When the colony reached the limit of possible expansion, the surplus population must be disposed of somehow; or the fierce struggle for existence must recommence and destroy that peace, which is the fundamental condition of the maintenance of the state of art against the state of nature.

If the administrator is guided purely by scientific considerations, he would work to restrict the population by removing &quot;the hopelessly diseased, the infirm aged, the weak or deformed in body or in mind, and the excess of infants born,&quot; just as a &quot;gardener pulls up defective and superfluous plants, or the breeder
destroys undesirable cattle. Only the strong and the healthy, carefully matched, with a view to the progeny best adapted to the purposes of the administrator, would be permitted to perpetuate their kind.&quot;

And so we have reached Social Darwinism. However, we do not have an idealized administrator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the more thoroughgoing of the multitudinous attempts to apply the principles of cosmic evolution, or what are supposed to be such, to social and political problems, which have appeared of late years, a considerable proportion appear to me to be based upon the notion that human society is competent to furnish, from its own resources, an administrator of the kind I have imagined. The pigeons, in short, are to be their own [[Sir John Sebright]]. A despotic government, whether individual or collective, is to be endowed with the preternatural intelligence, and with what, I am afraid, many will consider the preternatural ruthlessness, required for the purpose of carrying out the principle of improvement by selection, with the somewhat drastic thoroughness upon which the success of the method depends.  Experience certainly does not justify us in limiting the ruthlessness of individual &quot;saviors of society&quot;; and, on the well-known grounds of the aphorism which denies both body and soul to corporations, it seems probable (indeed the belief is not without support in history) that a collective despotism, a mob got to believe in its own divine right by demagogic missionaries, would be capable of more thorough work in this direction than any single tyrant, puffed up with the same illusion, has ever achieved.  But intelligence is another affair. The fact that &quot;saviors of society&quot; take to that trade is evidence enough that they have none to spare. And such as they possess is generally sold to the capitalists of physical force on whose resources they depend. However, I doubt whether even the keenest judge of character, if he had before him a hundred boys and girls under fourteen, could pick out, with the least chance of success, those who should be kept, as certain to be serviceable members of the polity, and those who should be chloroformed, as equally sure to be stupid, idle, or vicious. The &quot;points&quot; of a good or of a bad citizen are really far harder to discern than those of a puppy or a short-horn calf; many do not show themselves before the practical difficulties of life stimulate manhood to full exertion. And by that time the mischief is done. The evil stock, if it be one, has had time to multiply, and selection is nullified.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, humans are not cattle, nor flowers: the organization of human society is kept together by &quot;bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them.&quot; They do not even correspond to social insects such as bees: With bees, &quot;the members of the society are each organically predestined to the performance of one particular class of functions only. If they were endowed with desires, each could desire to perform none but those offices for which its organization specially fits it; and which, in view of the good of the whole, it is proper it should do.&quot; &quot;Among mankind, on the contrary, there is no such predestination to a sharply defined place in the social organism. However much men may differ in the quality of their intellects, the intensity of their passions, and the delicacy of their sensations, it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and nothing else. Moreover, with all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born&quot;, checked only by sympathy, familial and social bonds, and fear of the judgment of ones fellow man. &quot;Every forward step of social progress brings men into closer relations with their fellows, and increases the importance of the pleasures and pains derived from sympathy.&quot; 

In short, the creation of morality.

Since morality is what keeps the desire for selfishness in check, it is necessary to the propagation of society, with one requirement: the punishment of wrongdoers being necessary for the continuation of society, self-restraint must not be taken so far that wrongdoers may act unrestrained: Without the protection of society against them, &quot;the followers of the &quot;golden rule&quot; may indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley credits Hartley (Observations on Man (1749), vol. ii p. 281.) for not only having &quot;laid the foundations but built up much of the superstructure of a true theory of the Evolution of the intellectual and moral faculties and for having realized that the creation of civilization will in itself create ethics, if not in an evolutionary context.&quot; as well as [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley sums up this section of his argument against Social Darwinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have further shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the horticulturist and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part in the evolution of society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley finishes with a series of short, further evidences against Social Darwinism, including:

* Historical evidences against: Consider the vast changes of society between the Tudor and the Victorian eras; however, human nature, as evidenced by their writing, remains the same. &quot;In my belief, the innate qualities, physical, intellectual, and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the same for the last four or five centuries. If the struggle for existence has affected us to any serious extent (and I doubt it) it has been, indirectly, through our military and industrial wars with other nations.&quot;

* Whether some qualities are virtues or vices depends on circumstance: &quot;The benevolence and open-handed generosity which adorn a rich man, may make a pauper of a poor one; the energy and courage to which the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and daring subtlety to which the great financier owes his fortune, may very easily, under unfavorable conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows, or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable that the children of a &quot;failure&quot; will receive from their other parent just that little modification of character which makes all the difference. I sometimes wonder whether people, who talk so freely about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately consider their own history. Surely, one must be very &quot;fit,&quot; indeed, not to know of an occasion, or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have been only too easy to qualify for a place among the &quot;unfit.&quot;&quot;

&lt;!--Have skipped the struggle for means of enjoyment argument, as it's almost impossible to summaries--&gt;

==Evolution and religion==
:''See also: [[History of evolutionary thought]]''

Before Darwin's argument and presentation of the evidence for evolution, Western [[religion]]s generally discounted or condemned any claims that diversity of life is the result of an evolutionary process, as did most scientists in the English scientific establishment. However, evolution was accepted by some religious groups such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and the liberal [[Anglican]] theologians who went on to publish ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. as well as by many scientists in [[France]] and [[Scotland]] and some in [[England]], notably [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. Literal or authoritative interpretations of [[sacred text|Scripture]] hold that a [[supreme being]] directly created humans and other animals as separate &quot;[[Created kind]]s&quot;, which to some means species. This view is commonly referred to as [[creationism]]. In the West, the [[United States of America]] is the only country where creationist ideas are given serious consideration. From the 1920s to the present in the US, there has been a strong religious backlash to the teaching of evolution theory, particularly by conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. They have expressed concerns about the effects of the teaching of evolution on society and their faith (see [[Creation-evolution controversy]]).

In response to the wide scientific acceptance of the theory of evolution, many religions have formally or informally synthesized the scientific and religious viewpoints. Several important 20th century scientists ([[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]) whose work confirmed Darwin's theory, were also [[Christianity|Christians]] who saw no incompatibility between their experimental and theoretical confirmations of evolution and their faith. Some religions have adopted a [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]] viewpoint, where [[God]] provides a [[divine spark]] that ignited the process of evolution and (or), where God has guided evolution in one way or another. 

====Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church====
{{main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]], beginning in 1950 with [[Pope Pius XII]]'s encyclical Humani Generis, took up a neutral position with regard to evolution. &quot;The Church does not forbid that...research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter.&quot; [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html] 

In an [[October 22]], [[1996]], address to the [[Pontifical Academy of Science]], [[Pope John Paul II]] updated the Church's position, recognizing that Evolution is &quot;more than a hypothesis&quot; - ''&quot;In his encyclical Humani Generis, my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation... Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines.&quot; [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP961022.HTM]

====Jewish views on evolution====
{{main|Jewish views on evolution}}
==Evolutionary theory and the political left==
{{main|Evolutionary theory and the political left}}
The majority of those on the left do not oppose [[Darwinism]] ''per se'', but are critical of interpretations of evolutionary theory that, in their view, overemphasize the role of [[competition]] and ignore elements of [[co-operation]] in nature such as [[symbiosis]].

Many important political figures on the left have never publicized their views on [[biology]], and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, [[Marxist]]s are the exception. [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] supported Darwin's evolutionary theory. Marx even sent Darwin a copy of his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', though Darwin never wrote back to him. Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. He recognized that Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.

In 1861 Karl Marx wrote to his friend Ferdinand Lassalle, &quot;Darwin’s work is most important and suits my purpose in that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle. ... Despite all shortcomings, it is here that, for the first time, 'teleology' in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but its rational meaning is empirically explained.&quot;

Most later Marxists agreed with this view, but some - particularly those in the early [[Soviet Union]] - believed that evolutionary theory conflicted with their economic and social ideals. As a result, they came to support [[Lamarckism]] instead - the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. This led to the practice of [[Lysenkoism]], which caused agricultural problems.

In his book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued that co-operation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so.

On the contemporary moderate left, some authors such as [[Peter Singer]] (in his book, ''A Darwinian Left'') support Darwinism but reach different political and economic lessons than more conservative observers. Richard Dawkins' book, ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', has a chapter, &quot;Nice guys finish first&quot;, which attempts to explain the role of altruism and cooperation in evolution and how social animals not only cannot survive without such traits, but how evolution will create them. Dawkins explains that when an animal sacrifices itself or uses its resources for the survival of other members of the same species, its genes, present on the other animals, survive. For example, if a mother dies to save three of its pups, one and a half copies (on average) of its genes will survive, because there is a 50% chance of a particular gene being present in its offspring. Dawkins also made a documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeCn02l_Rw Nice guys finish first]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary, Dawkins added that chapter as a way of overcoming modern day misinterpretations of the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.

[[Image:Jacana jacana Niagara Falls Aviary.jpg|thumb|210px|Females of [[Wattled Jacana]] often carry out infanticide.]]
Within the field of [[social evolution]], '''Hamiltonian spite''' is a term for those behaviours that occur between (among) conspecifics, and have a cost for the actor and a negative impact (harm) for the recipient(s). Why do animals and humans exhibit spiteful behaviours? 

==Theories on altruism and spitefulness==

[[W. D. Hamilton]] published an influential paper on [[altruism]] in 1964 to explain why genetic kin tend to help each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. Part  I and II. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7: 1–16 and 17–52.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that genetically related individuals are likely to carry the copies of the same [[alleles]], thus helping kins may ensure that the copies of the actors' alleles pass into next generations. 

While this became a widely accepted and highly popular idea ever since then, however, few scientists noticed that he also published a second paper that modifies this view, or at least adds further important points to it. &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton WD 1970. Selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model. Nature 228: 1218–20.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper argues that by measuring the genetic relatedness between any two (randomly chosen) individuals of a population several times, we can identify an average level of relatedness. Theoretical models predict that (1) it is adaptive for an individual to be altruistic to any other individuals that are more closely related to it than this average level, and also that (2) it is adaptive for an individual to be spiteful against any other individuals that are less closely related to it than this average level. The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself. Hamilton mentioned birds and fishes exhibiting [[Infanticide (zoology)| infanticide]] (more specifically: ovicide) as examples for such behaviours.

Briefly, an individual can increase the chance of its genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations either by helping those that are more closely related, or by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance. &lt;ref&gt;Vickery WL, Brown JS, FitzGerald GJ 2003. Spite: altruism’s evil twin. Oikos, 102, 413–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Foster KR, Wenseleers T, Ratnieks FLW 2001. Spite: Hamilton’s unproven theory. Annales Zoologici Fennici 38: 229–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubts about the adaptive nature of spiteful behaviour==

Though altruism and spitefulness appears to be the sides of the same coin, however, there are good reasons why the latter one appears to be a less accepted idea among evolutionary biologists. 

First, unlike in the case of an altruist act, target individuals of aggression are likely to act in revenge: bites will provoke bites. Thus harming non-kins may be more costly than helping kins.

Second, presuming a [[Panmixia|panmictic population]], it is easy to see that the vast majority of pairs of individuals exhibit a roughly average level relatedness. For a given individual, the majority of others do not worth to help or harm. While it is easy to identify the few most closely related ones (see: [[kin recognition]]), it is also hard to identify the few genetically most distant ones.   

Most terrestrial [[vertebrates]] exhibit a certain degree of site fidelity, thus levels of kinship tend to correlate negatively with spatial distance. On one hand, this may provide some cues for them to identify the least related non-kin individuals. On the other hand, this may ensure that non-kins rarely if ever meet each other.

Many animal species exhibit [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]], i.e. adults tend to kill the eggs or the offspring of conspecifics, even if they do not feed on them (in the absence of [[cannibalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;van Schaik CP, Janson CH (eds.) 2000. Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of spitefulness is relatively free from the threat of revenge – provided that the parents and relatives of the target are either weak or far away.

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

An individual carrying a long-lasting infection of virulent pathogens may benefit from (1) channelling the flow of pathogens from its own body away from its kins and (2) directing them toward non-kin conspecifics. The adaptive nature of this behaviour has been supported by the analysis of theoretical models &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/transmission.pdf Rózsa L 1999. Influencing random transmission is a neutral character in hosts. Journal of Parasitology, 85, 1032–35.] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~fadionisio/Selfish_and_Spiteful_behaviour_parasites_pathogens2007.pdf Dionisio F 2007. Selfish and spiteful behaviour through parasites and pathogens. Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9: 1199-1210]&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the analyses of the behavioural repertoire of different animal species. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoologia.hu/list/spite.pdf Rózsa L 2000. Spite, xenophobia, and collaboration between hosts and parasites. Oikos 91: 396–400.] &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[tuberculosis]]-infected [[European badger]]s and [[rabies]]-infected [[dog]]s equally tend to emigrate from their natal ranges before starting to distribute the pathogens. It may worth to note that the drinking water supplied to garden birds need to be changed 1-2 times daily because birds so often defecate into it. Similarly, wild herds of [[Asian elephants]] tend to defecate into drinkwater holes apparently to keep rival herds away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct102005/1184.pdf Jog M, Watve M 2005. Role of parasites and commensals in shaping host behaviour. Current Science 89: 1184–91] &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Spiteful behaviour in humans==

===Wartime infanticide===

Throughout human history, [[war]] often emerges as a costly form of aggression typically targeting the non-kin enemy. Naturally, most wars appear to be motivated by potential benefits other than genetical. Nevertheless, the widespread occurrence of [[rape]] and [[infanticide]] during periods of war indicates Hamiltonian elements as well.

===Economy===  

It was recently suggested that spiteful motivations may also play a role in economic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Boari M 2007. The ethics of rationality. Elucidations in the theoretical foundations of economics by relation to ethics. In: Vranceanu R, Djelic M-L, editors. Moral foundations of management knowledge. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publications; p. 107–33. &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Aggression by means of pathogens===

Moreover, another paper argues that the motivation for biological aggression – i.e. using pathogens as weapons – is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.zoologia.hu/list/motivation.pdf Rózsa L 2009. The motivation for biological aggression is an inherent and common aspect of the human behavioural repertoire. Medical Hypotheses 72: 217–19.]&lt;/ref&gt; This argument contradicts the widespread belief that biological weapons are rare and aberrant tools of warfare and it is supported by the following observations: 
* the use of pathogen weapons predates the scientific understanding of infections and epidemics;
* attempts of biological aggression are easy to hide and to overlook, thus it appears to be underrepresented in written history; 
* it is a frequent component of our expectations concerning the likely behaviour of an enemy; 
* it is also a frequent component of threats (see e.g. ''white powder letters'');  
* several languages appear to bear linguistic references to our motivation for biological aggression in profanity. 
* given that wartime epidemics tend to kill people at a rate exceeding (or at least comparable to) that of traditional weapons, all wars fought in recorded history incorporated an implicit element of aggression by biological means.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gray536.png|right|300px|thumb|The human [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestigial structure; it no longer retains its original function.]]

'''Vestigiality''' describes [[homology (biology)|homologous]] [[character (biology)|characters]] of [[organism]]s which have seemingly lost all or most of their original [[function (biology)|function]] in a species through [[evolution]].&lt;!-- A sourced definition would be desirable; this one includes exaptations as a subset of vestiges --&gt; These may take various forms such as [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures, [[behavior]]s and [[biochemical]] pathways. Some of these disappear early in [[embryonic development]], but others are retained in adulthood. Although the term serves a purpose in many gross phenotypic characteristics, vestigial has probably little applicability to DNA sequences, be they genes or non-coding sequences. The term junk DNA is a revealing example. It is a value or judgmental term which has become less utilized in genetics as many of the sequences once believed to be “junk” have been discovered to have a function. 

'''Vestigial structures''' are often called ''vestigial organs'', although many of them are not actually [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. These are typically in a degenerate, atrophied, or rudimentary condition,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Eleanor (2005) ''Henderson's Dictionary of Biology''. Pearson, Prentice Hall. ISBN 0-13-127384-1&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to be much more [[genetic variation|variable]] than similar parts. Although structures usually called &quot;vestigial&quot; are largely or entirely functionless, a vestigial structure may retain lesser functions or develop minor new ones.&lt;ref name=Muller&gt;Muller, G. B. (2002) &quot;Vestigial Organs and Structures.&quot; in Encyclopedia of Evolution. Mark Pagel, editor in chief, New York: Oxford University Press. pp 1131-1133&lt;/ref&gt; However, care must be taken not to apply the label of vestigiality to [[exaptation]], in which a structure originally used for one purpose is modified for a new one.  For example, the wings of [[penguin]] or [[ostrich]] would not be vestigial, as they have been modified for a substantial new purpose (underwater locomotion or display respectively), while Darwin pointed out that those of an [[emu]] would be, as they have no major function now. 

Vestigial characters range on a continuum from detrimental through neutral to marginally useful. Some may be of some limited utility to an organism but still degenerate over time; the important point is not that they are without utility, but that they do not confer a significant enough advantage in terms of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] to avoid the random force of disorder that is [[mutation]]. It is difficult however to say that a vestigial character is detrimental to the organism in the long term - the future is unpredictable, and that which is of no use in the present may develop into something useful in the future. Vestigiality is one of several lines of evidence for biological evolution.
 
==History==
[[Image:Blindmaus-drawing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[blind mole rat]] (''Spalax typhlus'') has tiny eyes completely covered by a layer of skin.]]
Vestigial structures have been noticed since ancient times, and the reason for their existence was long speculated upon before [[Darwinian evolution]] provided a widely-accepted explanation. In the 4th century BC, [[Aristotle]] was one of the earliest writers to comment, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'', on the vestigial eyes of moles, calling them &quot;stunted in development&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]].[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/a8ha/ &quot;History of Animals&quot; (Book 1, Chapter 9)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in recent centuries have anatomical vestiges become a subject of serious study. In 1798, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] noted on vestigial structures:

{{cquotetxt|Whereas useless in this circumstance, these rudiments... have not been eliminated, because [[Natura non facit saltus|Nature never works by rapid jumps]], and She always leaves vestiges of an organ, even though it is completely superfluous, if that organ plays an important role in the other species of the same family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire, Geoffroy]] (1798). &quot;Observations sur l'aile de l'Autruche, par le citoyen Geoffroy&quot;, ''La Decade Egyptienne, Journal Litteraire et D'Economie Politique'' 1 (pp. 46&amp;ndash;51).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His colleague, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], named a number of vestigial structures in his 1809 book ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]''. Lamarck noted &quot;[[Guillaume-Antoine Olivier|Olivier]]'s ''[[blind mole rat|Spalax]]'', which lives underground like the mole, and is apparently exposed to daylight even less than the mole, has altogether lost the use of sight: so that it shows nothing more than vestiges of this organ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck, Jean-Baptiste]] (1809). ''[[Philosophie Zoologique|Philosophie zoologique]] ou exposition des considérations relatives à l'histoire naturelle des animaux''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was very familiar with the concept of vestigial structures, though the term for them did not yet exist. He listed a number of them in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', including the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|muscles of the ear]], [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[tail bone]], [[body hair]], and the [[Nictitating membrane|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[human eye|eye]]. Darwin also noted, in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', that a vestigial structure could be useless for its primary function, but still retain secondary anatomical roles: &quot;An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly efficient for the other.... [A]n organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object.&quot;&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of ''On the Origin of Species'', Darwin briefly mentioned [[inheritance of acquired characters]] under the heading &quot;''Effects of Use and Disuse''&quot;, expressing little doubt that use &quot;strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, 1859, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=152 134–139].&lt;!--also mentioned on pages 143, 161, 168, 447 and 490--&gt; Barrett P.H. et al. 1981, ''A concordance to Darwin's Origin of Species first edition'', Cornaell, Ithaca and London, lists only four mentions of the phrase &quot;use and disuse&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In later editions he expanded his thoughts on this,&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, A. &amp; Moore, J. (1991) ''Darwin'' Penguin Books p.617 &quot;Darwin was loathe to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and in the final chapter of the 6th edition concluded that species have been modified &quot;chiefly through the natural selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin (1872) ''[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]'', 6th Edn., p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=449 421]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Robert Wiedersheim]] published a list of 86 human organs that had, in his words, &quot;lost their original physiological significance&quot;. Theorizing that they were vestiges of evolution, he called them &quot;vestigial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Wiedersheim|Wiedersheim, Robert]] (1893). ''The Structure of Man: an index to his past history.'' London: Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his time, the function of some of these structures has been discovered, while other anatomical vestiges have been unearthed, making the list primarily of interest as a record of the knowledge of human anatomy at the time. Later versions of Wiedersheim's list were expanded to as many as 180 human &quot;vestigial organs&quot;. This is why the zoologist Newman stated in the [[Scopes Trial]] that &quot;There are, according to Wiedersheim, no less than 180 vestigial structures in the human body, sufficient to make of a man a veritable walking museum of antiquities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Common descent and evolutionary history ==
{{Further|[[Evidence of common descent]]}}

Vestigial structures are often [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to structures that are functioning normally in other species. Therefore, vestigial structures can be considered evidence for [[evolution]], the process by which beneficial heritable traits arise in populations over an extended period of time. The existence of vestigial traits can be attributed to changes in the environment and behavior patterns of the organism in question. As the function of the trait is no longer beneficial for survival, the likelihood that future offspring will inherit the &quot;normal&quot; form of it decreases. In some cases the structure becomes detrimental to the organism (for example the eyes of a mole can become infected&lt;ref name=Darwin /&gt;). In many cases the structure is of no direct harm, yet all structures require extra [[energy]] in terms of development, maintenance, and weight, and are also a risk in terms of disease (e.g. [[infection]], [[cancer]]), providing some [[natural selection|selective]] pressure for the removal of parts that do not contribute to an organism's fitness. A structure that is not harmful will obviously take longer to be 'phased out' than one that is.  However, some vestigial structures may persist due to limitations in development, such that complete loss of the structure could not occur without major alterations of the organism's developmental pattern, and such alterations would likely produce numerous negative side-effects. The toes of many animals such as [[horses]], who stand on a single [[toe]], are still evident in a vestigial form and may become evident, although rarely, from time to time in individuals. 

The vestigial versions of the structure can be compared to the original version of the structure in other species in order to determine the homology of a vestigial structure. Homologous structures indicate [[common descent|common ancestry]] with those organisms that have a functional version of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Futuyma]] has stated that vestigial structures make no sense without evolution, just as spelling and usage of many modern [[English language|English]] words can only be explained by their [[Latin]] or [[Old Norse]] antecedents.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vestigial traits can still be considered [[adaptation]]s. This is because an adaptation is often defined as a trait that has been favored by natural selection. Adaptations therefore need not be ''adaptive'', as long as they were at some point. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Examples==
===Animals===
[[Image:Whale skeleton.png|350px|thumb|Letter ''c'' in the picture indicates the undeveloped hind legs of a [[baleen whale]].]]
Vestigial characters are present throughout the [[animal]] kingdom, and an almost endless list could be given. Darwin said that &quot;[i]t would be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some part or other is not in a rudimentary condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=Darwin /&gt;

In [[whale]]s and other [[cetacean]]s, one can find small vestigial leg bones deeply buried within the back of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bejder L, Hall BK |title=Limbs in whales and limblessness in other vertebrates: mechanisms of evolutionary and developmental transformation and loss |journal=Evol. Dev. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=445–58 |year=2002 |pmid=12492145 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142X.2002.02033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are remnants of their land-living ancestors' legs. Many whales also have undeveloped, unused, [[pelvis]] bones in the [[anterior]] part of their torsos.  

The wings of [[ostrich]]es, [[emu]]s, and other [[flightless bird]]s are vestigial; they are remnants of their flying ancestors' wings.

The eyes of certain [[cavefish]] and [[salamander]]s are vestigial, as they no longer allow the organism to see, and are remnants of their ancestors' functional eyes. 

[[Boidae|Boa]]s and [[Pythonidae|python]]s have vestigial pelvis remnants which are externally visible as two small [[anal spurs]] on each side of the cloaca. These spurs are sometimes used in copulation, but are not essential, as no colubroid snake (the vast majority of species) possesses these remnants. Furthermore, in most snakes the left lung is greatly reduced or absent. [[Amphisbaenia]]ns, which independently evolved limblessness, also retain vestiges of the pelvis as well as the pectoral girdle, and have lost their right lung.

[[Crabs]] have small tails tucked between their rear legs that are probably vestigial, as they are no longer in use. The working version of these tails can be found in their close [[crustacean]] relative, the [[lobster]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Certain species of [[moth]]s (for example the [[Gypsy moth]]) have females that, although flightless, still carry small wings. These wings have no use, and are vestigial to the versions in species whose females can fly.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The [[fruit fly]] can be bred in high school experiments to produce offspring with vestigial wings, to better understand basic genetics in biology.

====Humans====
{{Main|Human vestigiality}}
[[Image:Darwin-s-tubercle.jpg|225px|thumb|The muscles connected to the ears of a human do not develop enough to have the same mobility allowed to monkeys.]]
Human vestigiality is related to [[human evolution]], and includes a variety of characters occurring in the [[human]] species. Many of these are also vestigial in other [[primate]]s and related animals. The [[vermiform appendix]] is a vestige of the [[cecum]], an organ that would have been used to digest [[cellulose]] by humans' herbivorous ancestors.&lt;ref name=Descent&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1871). ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]''. John Murray: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous organs in other animals similar to humans continue to perform that function, whereas other meat-eating animals may have similarly diminished appendices. In line with the possibility of vestigial organs developing new functions, some research suggests that the appendix may guard against the loss of symbiotic bacteria that aid in digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Humans also bear some vestigial behaviors and reflexes. The formation of [[goose bump]]s in humans under [[stress (medicine)|stress]] is a vestigial [[reflex action|reflex]];&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. (1872) ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' John Murray, London.&lt;/ref&gt; its function in human ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators. Raising the hair is also used to trap an extra layer of air, keeping an animal warm. Due to the diminished amount of hair in humans, the reflex formation of goosebumps when cold is also vestigial. [[Infant]]s are also able to support their own weight while hanging from a rod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Murphy | first = L. B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; responding to certain tactile stimuli. An ancestral primate would have had sufficient body hair for an infant to cling to, allowing its mother to escape from danger, such as climbing up a tree in the presence of a [[predator]].

There are also vestigial molecular structures in humans, which are no longer in use but may indicate common ancestry with other species. One example of this is [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]], a gene, that is functional in most other mammals, which produces an [[enzyme]] that can make [[vitamin C]]. A mutation inactivated the gene in an ancestor of the current group of [[primate]]s, and it now remains in the [[human genome]] as a vestigial sequence called a [[pseudogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Medea''', short for ''maternal-effect dominant embryonic arrest'', is a [[Intragenomic conflict|selfish gene]] composed of a toxin and an antidote.  A mother carrying ''Medea'' will [[Gene expression|express]] the toxin in her germline, killing her progeny.  If the children also carry ''Medea'', they produce copies of the antidote, saving their lives.  Therefore, if a mother carries ''Medea'', and her children don't, the children die.

Medea's selfish behavior gives it a selective advantage over normal genes.  If introduced into a population at sufficiently high levels, the ''Medea'' gene will spread, replacing entire populations of normal flies with flies carrying ''Medea''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wade&quot;&gt;Wade, M.J. and Beeman, R.W. (1994) The Population Dynamics of Maternal-Effect Selfish Genes.  Genetics 138: 1309-1314.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, ''Medea'' has been proposed as a way of [[Genetic engineering|genetically modifying]] insect populations.  By linking the ''Medea'' construct to a gene of interest - for instance, a gene conferring resistance to malaria - ''Medea'''s unique dynamics could be exploited to drive both genes into a population.  These findings have dramatic implications for the control of insect-borne diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]].

''Medea'' is the only [[Intragenomic conflict|selfish gene]] that has been synthesized in the lab and tested in the [[fruit fly]] ''Drosophila melanogaster''.  The toxin was a [[microRNA]] that blocked the expression of ''myd88'', a [[gene]] vital for embryonic development in [[insect|insects]].  The antidote was an extra copy of ''myd88''.  The offspring receiving the extra copy of ''myd88'' survived and hatched, while those without the extra copy died.  In lab trials where 25% of the original members were [[homozygous]] for ''Medea'', the gene spread to the entire population within 10 to 12 generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;chen&quot;&gt;Chen, C-H. et al. (2007) A Synthetic Maternal-Effect Selfish Genetic Element Drives Population Replacement In Drosophila.  ''Science'': 316(5824):597-600.  [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;316/5824/597 DOI: 10.1126/science.1566060]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Medea was named for the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of [[Medea]], who killed her children when her husband left her for another woman.  The reference is appropriate since Medea kills all progeny that do not carry it.

[[Image:Daisyworld-gbooth-swingdaisyball.gif|thumb|right|Progress of a Daisyworld-Simulation with many breeds and a medium scale iteration level]]
'''Daisyworld''', a [[computer simulation]], is a hypothetical world [[orbit]]ing a [[sun]] whose radiant energy is slowly increasing. It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system, and was introduced by [[James Lovelock]] and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] in a paper published in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=A.J. |authorlink=Andrew Watson (scientist) |coauthors=J.E. Lovelock |title=Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld |journal=[[Tellus (journal)|Tellus B]] |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=286–9 |publisher=[[International Meteorological Institute]] |date=1983 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the plausibility of the [[Gaia hypothesis]].  In the original 1983 version, Daisyworld is seeded with two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of [[Asteraceae|daisy]] as its only life forms: black daisies and white daisies. White petaled daisies reflect [[light]], while black petaled daisies absorb light. The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun's rays grow more powerful.   The surface temperature of daisyworld remains almost constant over a broad range of solar output.
 
  
== Original 1983 Simulation Synopsis ==

At the beginning of the simulation, the sun's rays are weak and Daisyworld is too cold to support any life. Its surface is barren, and grey. As the [[luminosity]] of the sun's rays increases, germination of black daisies becomes possible. Because black daisies absorb more of the sun's radiant energy, they are able to increase their individual temperatures to healthy levels on the still cool surface of Daisyworld. As a result they thrive and the population soon grows large enough to increase the average surface temperature of Daisyworld.    

As the surface heats up, it becomes more habitable for white daisies, whose competing population grows to rival the black daisy population. As the two populations reach equilibrium, so too does the surface temperature of Daisyworld, which settles on a value most comfortable for both populations. 

In this first phase of the simulation we see that black daisies have warmed Daisyworld so that it is habitable over a wider range of solar luminosity than would have been possible on a barren, gray planet. This allowed growth of the white daisy population, and the two populations of daisies are now working together to regulate the surface temperature.  

The second phase of the simulation documents what happens as the sun's luminosity continues to increase, heating the surface of Daisyworld beyond a comfortable range for the daisies. This temperature increase causes white daisies, who are better able to stay cool because of their high [[albedo]] or ability to reflect sunlight, to gain a selective advantage over the black daisies. White daisies begin replacing black daisies, which has a cooling effect on Daisyworld. The result is that Daisyworld's surface temperature remains habitable - in fact almost constant - even as the luminosity of the sun continues to increase.

In the third phase of the simulation, the sun's rays have grown so powerful that soon even the white daisies can no longer survive. At a certain luminosity their population crashes, and the barren, gray surface of Daisyworld, no longer able to reflect the sun's rays, rapidly heats up. 

At this point in the simulation solar luminosity is programmed to decline, retracing its original path to its initial value. Even as it declines to levels that previously supported vast populations of daisies in the third phase, no daisies are able to grow because the surface of barren, gray Daisyworld is still far too hot. Eventually, the sun's rays decrease in power to a more comfortable level which allows white daisies to grow, who begin cooling the planet.

== Relevance to Earth ==

Because Daisyworld is so simplistic, having for example, no atmosphere, no animals, only one species of plant life, no consideration of evolution and only the most basic population growth and death models, it should not be directly compared to Earth. This was stated very clearly by the original authors. Even so, it is believed{{Who|date=March 2009}} to provide a number of useful predictions of how Earth's biosphere may respond to, for example, human interference. Later adaptations of Daisyworld (discussed below), which added many layers of complexity, still showed the same basic trends of the original model.

One prediction of the simulation is that the biosphere works to regulate the climate, making it habitable over a wide range of solar luminosity. Many examples of these regulatory systems have been found on Earth{{Fact|date=March 2009}}, and of those found, most act to cool the global temperature by sequestering carbon{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. This suggests that Earth is in the third phase of Daisyworld (see Original 1983 Simulation Synopsis), in which white daisies are struggling to keep the surface cool. 

Towards the end of the third phase the simulation shows that the regulatory ability of Daisyworld is ultimately finite. As the system begins to fail the temperature of the planet slowly increases and, soon after, this triggers a mass extinction of the daisy population and a rapid spike in surface temperature. On Earth, an anthropogenic-induced mass extinction of plants and animals is believed to be underway &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=J.A. |coauthors=M.G. Telfer, D.B. Roy, C.D. Preston, J.J.D. Greenwood, J. Asher, R. Fox, R.T. Clarke, J.H. Lawton |title=Comparative Losses of British Butterflies, Birds and Plants and the Global Extinction Crisis |journal=[[Science]] |volume=303 |issue=5665 |pages=1879-1881 |date=2004 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is expected to reduce the planet's ability to sequester carbon and cool the climate. At the same time, significant amounts of carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere. Earth's regulatory system is now beginning to show signs of these stresses{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. Within the past century the average surface temperature has been gradually increasing, and in more recent decades, this increase has begun to accelerate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter3.pdf | title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Chapter 3 | accessdate=2009-03-14 | author= | last= | first= | authorlink= | coauthors= | date=2007-02-05 | year= | month= | format= | work= | publisher= | location= | pages=237 | language= | doi= | archiveurl= | archivedate= | dateformat= | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These symptoms are similar to those that precede the collapse of life on Daisyworld.

== Modifications to the Original Simulation ==

Later extensions of the Daisyworld simulation included [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es and other species. One of the more surprising findings of these simulations is that the larger the number of species, the greater the improving effects on the entire planet (i.e., the temperature regulation was improved). These findings lent support to the idea that [[biodiversity]] is valuable.

Daisyworld has also attracted a substantial amount of criticism{{Who|date=March 2009}} since 1983. Much of the criticism centers around the fact that although it is often used as an analogy for Earth, the original simulations leaves out many important details of the true [[Earth]] system. For example, the system requires an ad-hoc death rate (γ) to sustain homeostasis, and it does not take into account the difference between species-level phenomena and individual level phenomena. Detractors{{Who|date=March 2009}} of the simulation believed inclusion of these details would cause it to become unstable, and therefore, false. Many of these issues are addressed in a more recent paper by Timothy Lenton and James Lovelock in 2001 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenton |first=T.M. |coauthors=J.E. Lovelock |title=Daisyworld revisited: quantifying biological effects on planetary self-regulation |journal=[[Tellus Series B - Chemical and Physical Meterology]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |date=2001 |pages=288–305 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0889.2001.01191.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this paper it is shown that inclusion of these factors actually improves Daisyworld's ability to regulate its climate.

A version of the Daisyworld simulation, with several shades of gray daisies, was included in the [[Maxis]] video game ''[[SimEarth]]''. [[Orson Scott Card]]'s novel ''[[Xenocide]]'' also makes several references to Daisyworld.

&lt;!--REFERENCES END--&gt;
This statement arises because ''evolution'' is used in two ways. In short, the word is [[ambiguity | ambiguous]]. The &quot;fact of evolution&quot; refers to the changes in populations of biological organisms over time, which are known to have occurred through [[Observation#Observations in science|scientific observations]] and [[Experiment|experiments]]. The &quot;theory of evolution&quot; refers to the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], which is the current scientific explanation of how these changes occur. Misuse and misunderstanding of these terms have been used to construct arguments disputing the validity of the theory of evolution.

The distinction between fact and theory is not limited to the study of evolution. The [[law of gravity]] is a scientific fact that bodies of mass attract each other, but there are different [[History of gravitational theory|theories of gravity]] that attempt to explain how bodies of mass are attracted to each other. In this way, ''gravity'' is both a scientific fact and a [[scientific theory]].

On its own, the word &quot;evolution&quot; often refers to the combination of the underlying facts, and the theory that explains them. However, it is also frequently used to refer to one or the other, so care may be needed to determine an author's meaning.

==Evolution, fact and theory==
Evolution has been described as &quot;fact and theory&quot;, &quot;fact not theory&quot;, and &quot;only a theory, not a fact&quot;. This illustrates a terminological confusion that hampers discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/a/6401 Is &quot;Evolution&quot; a &quot;Theory&quot; or &quot;Fact&quot; or Is This Just a Trivial Game of Semantics?] by Casey Luskin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/terminology.html#author Commitee for Skeptical Inquiry — Evolution &amp; Creationism: Terminology in Conflict] by Richard Joltes&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of the terms &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; are described below.

===Evolution===
{{main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}
Evolution is usually defined simply as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next. However, &quot;evolution&quot; is often used to include the following additional claims:

#Differences in trait composition between isolated populations over many generations may result in the [[speciation|origin of new species]].
#All living organisms alive today have descended from a [[common descent|common ancestor]] (or ancestral gene pool).

According to [[Douglas Futuyma]]:
{{quote|Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest proto-organism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.&lt;ref name=futuyma&gt;{{cite book | first = Douglas J. | last = Futuyma | title = , Evolutionary Biology, 3rd ed. | year = 1997 | publisher = Sinauer Associates | isbn = 0878931899 | page = 751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term &quot;evolution&quot;, especially when referred to as a &quot;theory&quot;, is also used more broadly to incorporate processes such as [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]].

===Fact===
{{main|Scientific fact}}
Fact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental data or objective verifiable observations. &quot;Fact&quot; is also used in a wider sense to mean any hypothesis for which there is overwhelming evidence.

|}

Evolution is a fact in the sense of it being overwhelmingly validated by the evidence. Frequently evolution is said to be a fact in the same way as the Earth revolving around the Sun is a fact.&lt;ref name=futyuma2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research Guardian article by Richard Dawkins, Jerry Coyne]&lt;/ref&gt; The following quotation from H. J. Muller, &quot;One Hundred Years Without Darwin Are Enough&quot; explains the point.

:''There is no sharp line between speculation, hypothesis, theory, principle, and fact, but only a difference along a sliding scale, in the degree of probability of the idea. When we say a thing is a fact, then, we only mean that its probability is an extremely high one: so high that we are not bothered by doubt about it and are ready to act accordingly. Now in this use of the term fact, the only proper one, evolution is a fact.''&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt; 

The National Academy of Science (U.S.) makes a similar point:

:''Scientists most often use the word &quot;fact&quot; to describe an observation. But scientists can also use fact to mean something that has been tested or observed  so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples. The occurrence of evolution in this sense is fact. Scientists no longer question whether descent with modification occurred because the evidence is so strong.''&lt;ref name=SciCreatNAS&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=28 ''Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition (1999)'', National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy Press, Washington DC, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers of science argue that we do not know anything with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be &quot;theory laden&quot; and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used. In this sense all facts are provisional.

===Theory===

*A scientific theory is a well supported body of interconnected statements that explains observations and can be used to make testable predictions.
|}

Scientific [[Theory|theories]] describe the coherent framework into which observable data fit. The  &quot;theory of evolution&quot; is the framework that best explains [[Talk:Evolution/FAQ#Has evolution ever been observed? | observed]] changes of species over time and best predicts the new observations that continue to be made in evolutionary biology and related sciences.

The [[Theory#Science|scientific definition]] of the word &quot;theory&quot; is different from the [[wiktionary:colloquial|colloquial]] sense of the word. Colloquially, &quot;theory&quot; can mean a [[conjecture]], an [[opinion]], or a [[speculation]] that does not have to be based on facts or make testable predictions. In science, the meaning of theory is more rigorous: a theory must be based on observed facts and make testable predictions.

In science, a current theory is a theory that has no equally acceptable or more acceptable alternative theory, and has survived attempts at [[falsifiability|falsification]]. That is, there have been no observations made which contradict it to this point and, indeed, every observation ever made either supports the current theory or at least does not falsify it by contradicting it completely. A revision of the current theory, or the generation of a new theory is necessary if new observations contradict the current theory, as the current findings are in need of a new explanation (see [[scientific revolution]] or [[paradigm shift]]). However, the falsification of a theory does not falsify the facts on which the theory is based.

==Evolution compared with gravity==
{{see also|Gravity|History of gravitational theory}}
The terms &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; can be applied to evolution, just as they are to gravity.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; 

There have been many theories that attempt to explain the fact of gravity. That is, scientists ask what gravity is, and what causes it. They develop a model to explain gravity, a theory of gravity. Many explanations of gravity that qualify as a ''Theory of Gravity'' have been proposed over the centuries: [[Aristotle]]'s, [[Galileo]]'s, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s, and now [[Einstein]]'s. Confusion of the terms can arise when we use a single word to describe both the observed facts and the theory that explains it. The word ‘’gravity’’ can be used to refer to the observed facts (i.e., the observed attraction of masses) and the theory used to explain it (i.e., the reason why masses attract each other). Thus, gravity is both a &quot;theory&quot; and a &quot;fact.&quot;

In the study of biological species, the facts include fossils and measurements of these fossils. The location of a fossil is an example of a 
fact (using the scientific meaning of the word fact). In species that rapidly reproduce, for example  [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], the process of evolutionary change has been observed in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dobzhansky T, Pavlovsky O |title=Experimentally created incipient species of Drosophila |journal=Nature |volume=230 |issue=5292 |pages=289–92 |year=1971 |pmid=5549403 |doi=10.1038/230289a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The observation of fruit fly populations changing character is also an example of a fact. So evolution is a fact just as the observations of gravity are a fact.  

In biology, there have been many attempts to explain these observations over the years. [[Lamarckism]], [[Transmutationism]] and [[Orthogenesis]] were all non-Darwinian theories that attempted to explain the observations of species and fossils and other evidence. However, the '''Theory of Evolution''' is the explanation for all relevant observations regarding the development of life, based on a model that explains all the available data and observations. Thus, evolution is not only a fact but also a theory, just as gravity is both a fact and a theory.

==Evolution as theory and fact in the literature==
The confusion between &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; and the use of the word &quot;evolution&quot; is largely due to some authors using evolution to refer to the changes that occur within species over generations and common descent, while others use the term more generally to include the mechanisms driving the change. However, among biologists at least, there seems to be consensus that evolution is a fact:  

*American zoologist and paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson|George Simpson]] stated that '' 'Darwin...finally and definitely established evolution as a fact.' ''&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{cite web | title = Is the theory of evolution merely a &quot;theory&quot;? | url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_stat.htm | date = 2005-08-30 | last = Robinson | first = B.A. | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | language = english | format = html }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
*[[H. J. Muller]] has written, '' 'If you like, then, I will grant you that in an absolute sense evolution is not a fact, or rather, that it is no more a fact than that you are hearing or reading these words.' ''&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt;
*[[Kenneth R. Miller]] writes, '' 'evolution is as much a fact as anything we know in science.' ''&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;&quot;{{cite book |author=Miller, Kenneth S. |title=Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution (P.S.) |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York, N.Y |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=0061233501 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ernst Mayr]] has observed '' 'The basic theory of evolution has been confirmed so completely that most modern biologists consider evolution simply a fact. How else except by the word evolution can we designate the sequence of faunas and floras in precisely dated geological strata? And evolutionary change is also simply a fact owing to the changes in the content of gene pools from generation to generation.' ''&lt;ref name=Mayr/&gt;

====Evolution as fact ''and'' theory====

Commonly &quot;fact&quot; is used to refer to the observable changes in organisms' traits over generations while the word &quot;theory&quot; is reserved for the mechanisms that cause these changes:

*[[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] writes, '' 'Evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of gravitation replaced Newton's, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome.  And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.' ''&lt;ref name=gouldfact/&gt;
*Similarly, biologist [[Richard Lenski]] says '' 'Scientific understanding requires both facts and theories that can explain those facts in a coherent manner. Evolution, in this context, is both a fact and a theory. It is an incontrovertible fact that organisms have changed, or evolved, during the history of life on Earth. And biologists have identified and investigated mechanisms that can explain the major patterns of change.' ''&lt;ref name=Lenski/&gt;

====Evolution as fact ''not'' theory====

Other commentators, focusing on the changes in species over generations and in some cases common ancestry have stressed that evolution is a fact to emphasize the weight of supporting evidence while denying it is helpful to use the term &quot;theory&quot;: 

*[[R. C. Lewontin]] wrote, '''It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is a fact, not theory.' ''&lt;ref name=Lewontin&gt;{{cite journal | first = R. C. | last = Lewontin  | title = Evolution/creation debate: A time for truth | journal = Bioscience | volume = 31 | pages = 559 | year = 1981 }}

*[[Douglas Futuyma]] writes in his Evolutionary Biology book '' 'The statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun.' ''&lt;ref name=futuyma/&gt;
*[[Richard Dawkins]] says, '' 'One thing all real scientists agree upon is the fact of evolution itself. It is a fact that we are cousins of gorillas, kangaroos, starfish, and bacteria. Evolution is as much a fact as the heat of the sun. It is not a theory, and for pity’s sake, let’s stop confusing the philosophically naive by calling it so. Evolution is a fact.'

*[[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Neil Campbell]] wrote in his 1990 biology textbook, '' 'Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution.' ''&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book | first = Neil A. | last = Campbell | title = Biology 6th ed. | date = 2002-02-05 | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | isbn = 0805366245 | coauthors = Reece, Jane B. | page = 1175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictive power==
A central tenet in [[science]] is that a scientific theory is supposed to have [[predictive power]], and verification of predictions are seen as an important and necessary support for the theory. The theory of evolution did provide such predictions. Three examples are:

* Genetic information must be transmitted in a molecular way that will be almost exact but permit slight changes. Since this prediction was made, biologists have discovered the existence of [[DNA]], which has a mutation rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; per [[nucleotide]] per [[cell division]]; this provides just such a mechanism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Alberts&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author1=Bruce Alberts |author1-link=Bruce Alberts |author2=Alexander Johnson |author3=Julian Lewis |author4=Martin Raff |author5=Keith Roberts |author6=Peter Walter |author6-link=Peter Walter |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |publisher=Routledge |date=March, 2002 |binding=hardcover |totalpages=1616 |weight=7.6 pounds |isbn=0-8153-3218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some DNA sequences are shared by very different organisms. It has been predicted by the theory of evolution that the differences in such DNA sequences between two organisms should roughly resemble both the biological difference between them according to their [[anatomy]] and the time that had passed since these two organisms have separated in the course of evolution, as seen in [[fossil]] evidence. The rate of accumulating such changes should be low for some sequences, which code for critical [[RNA]] or [[protein]]s, and high for others - that code for less critical RNA or proteins; but for every specific sequence, the rate of change should be roughly constant through evolution. These results have been experimentally confirmed. Two examples are DNA sequences coding for [[rRNA]] which is highly conserved, and DNA sequences coding for [[fibrinopeptides]] ([[amino acid]] chains which are discarded during the formation of [[fibrin]]), which are highly non-conserved.&lt;ref name = &quot;Alberts&quot;/&gt;

* Prior to 2004, paleontologists had found fossils of amphibians with necks, ears, and four legs, in rock no older than 365 million years old.  In rocks more than 385 million years old they could only find fish, without these amphibian characteristics.  Evolutionary theory predicted that since amphibians evolved from fish, an intermediate form should be found in rock dated between 365 and 385 million years ago. Such an intermediate form should have many fish-like characteristics, conserved from 385 million years ago or more, but also have many amphibian characteristics as well.  In 2004, an expedition to islands in the Canadian arctic searching specifically for this fossil form in rocks that were 375 million years old discovered fossils of [[Tiktaalik]].&lt;ref name=Shubin&gt;&quot;{{cite book |author=Shubin, Neil. |title=Your Inner Fish |publisher=Pantheon |location= |year= 2008|pages= |isbn=9780375424472 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts and terminology==

*Speculative or conjectural explanations are called [[hypothesis|hypotheses]]. Well-tested explanations  are called ''theories''.  

*&quot;Fact&quot; does not mean &quot;absolute certainty&quot;. In the words of Stephen J. Gould: ''In science, &quot;fact&quot; can only mean &quot;confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.&quot;'' &lt;ref name=gouldfact/&gt;

*&quot;Proof&quot; of a theory does not exist in [[natural sciences]]. Proof only exists in [[formal sciences]], such as [[Mathematical proof|mathematics]]. Experimental observation of the predictions made by a hypothesis or theory is called ''validation''.

*A ''scientific law'' is a concept related to a ''scientific theory''. Very well-established &quot;theories&quot; that rely on a simple principle are often called scientific &quot;laws&quot;. For example, it is common to encounter reference to &quot;the law of gravity&quot;, &quot;the law of natural selection&quot;, or the &quot;laws of evolution.&quot;

[[Image:Blue-lobster.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[American lobster#Mutations|blue lobster]] is an example of a mutant.]]
A '''mutant''' is an individual, organism, or new genetic character arising or resulting from an instance of [[mutation]], which is a base-pair sequence change within the [[DNA]] of a [[gene]] or [[chromosome]] of an organism resulting in the creation of a new character or [[Trait (biological)|trait]] not found in the [[wild type]]. The natural occurrence of genetic mutations is integral to the process of [[evolution]]. The study of mutants is an integral part of biology, by understanding the effect that a mutation in a gene has it is possible to establish the normal function of that gene. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/68/9/2112.abstract Clock Mutants of ''Drosophila melanogaster''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Although not all mutations have a noticeable [[phenotypic]] effect, the common usage of the word '''mutant''' is generally a [[pejorative]] term only used for noticeable mutations.&lt;ref&gt;Mutant. (n.d.). ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition. Retrieved March 05, 2008, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mutant&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific usage is broader, referring to any organism differing from the wildtype.

'''Mutants''' should not be confused with organisms born with [[Developmental abnormality|developmental abnormalities]], which are caused by errors during [[morphogenesis]]. In a developmental abnormality, the DNA of the organism is unchanged and the abnormality cannot be passed on to progeny. [[Conjoined twins]] are the result of developmental abnormalities.

Chemicals that cause developmental abnormalities are called [[teratogen]]s; these may also cause mutations, but their effect on development is not related to mutations.  Chemicals that induce mutations are called [[mutagen]]s. Most mutagens are also considered to be [[carcinogen]]s.

''This is the greatest discovery of the scientific enterprise: You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebushes, giraffes, and humans''&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Brian Swimme by Susan Bridle, ''Enlightenment Magazine'' issue 19 [http://www.thegreatstory.org/SwimmeWIE.pdf The Great Story]&lt;/ref&gt;. This statement by Swimme has been widely quoted.&lt;ref&gt;Diana deRegnier, American Chronicle,Tue Feb 17 2009[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/86703]&lt;/ref&gt;. For this mathematical cosmologist ''&quot;the Universe is a continuous, radiant, numinous revelation.

==Philosophy==
Eric Chaisson writes that – 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Brian Swimme, a mathematician by training, seeks that larger, warmer, more noble science story, stating that, not merely a collection of facts, science should be a student’s guide to a grand worldview, including, if possible, meaning, purpose and value, he sees the cosmological perspective as one to which all modern scientists can objectively subscribe, yet the meaning and purpose of it being a subjective outgrowth of an individual’s reflections upon that cosmology. &lt;ref&gt;Eric Chaisson, Tʻae-chʻang Kim, Tae-Chang Kim, The Thirteenth Labor: Improving Science Education, CRC Press, 1999, page 9, ISBN-9057005387 [ http://books.google.com/books?id=7MAoPSHE3mgC]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a 2007 interview with [[Robert Wright]], Swimme says -  
&lt;blockquote&gt;..if you take Buddhism and Christianity and so forth there's a kind of battle — a subtle sort of struggle taking place because they're not standing in a common ground but ... take the Earth or ecology then suddenly they can begin to explore what they have to offer. So I do think I do think absolutely that ... there will be a flourishing of religions, not a withering away. And they will flourish to the degree that they will move into the context of planet and universe. I even think that as a matter of fact that ... some of the central insights of the religions are more powerfully presented by what we know about the universe now then when they were first formulated.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt; Interview with [[Robert Wright]] (2007) [http://meaningoflife.tv/transcript.php?speaker=swimme Full transcript online] [http://meaningoflife.tv/video.php?speaker=swimme&amp;topic=complete Full video online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpt from Pacific Sun Magazine -
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Big Bang, Big Story - Brian Swimme at the forefront of a new movement - The Universe Story - that integrates Science and Sprituality -  

The Universe Story, often called the New Story ([[Epic of Evolution]]), is a cosmological narrative that begins with the big bang, which started the whole process, and works through the evolution of the Universe, which includes life on Earth. But more than a so-what summary from a science textbook, this chronology promotes deeper relationships through scientific data (…)This manner of study, which engages heart and mind together, seems to teeter on the brink of religion. But it isn't religion; it's science. However, the New Story people claim that science, absorbed holistically, can have a soul-shaking impact on people(…)Big-picture science is filled with little mysterious coincidences, upon which our entire existence rests. Small wonder that reflecting deeply upon these data would inspire awe—even humility as cosmology gently puts people in their place (…)  &quot;The current common sense understanding of the Earth is as a gravel pit or a hardware store,&quot; said Swimme, explaining that the modern period has been &quot;organized around the theory that Earth is just stuff we can use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp EXCERPT FROM PACIFIC SUN MAGAZINE]retrieved 3-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolution''' is the process of change in all forms of life over generations, and [[evolutionary biology]] is the study of how evolution occurs. 

Every generation an [[organism]] [[heredity|inherits]] features (called ''traits'') from its parents through [[gene]]s. Changes (called [[mutation]]s) in the genes can produce a new trait in the offspring of an organism. Traits which help the organism survive and reproduce are more likely to accumulate in a population than traits that are unfavorable, a process called natural selection. The overproduction of offspring and [[heritability]] of traits are two additional facts of life that support the scientific foundation of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gould | first = Stephen J. | title = The Structure of Evolutionary Theory | publisher = Harvard University Press | date= 2002 | pages = 1433 | isbn = 0674006135, 9780674006133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

With each passing generation, some traits become more common in populations of organisms while other traits disappear. The forces of evolution are most evident when populations become isolated, either through geographic distance or by some other mechanism preventing genetic exchange. After enough time, isolated populations can branch off into new [[speciation|species]].&lt;ref name= berk&gt;{{citation| year =2008 | publication-date = | contribution =An introduction to evolution| contribution-url =http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_02| title =Understanding Evolution: your one-stop source for information on evolution| publisher = The University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley | url =http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/evo_01|format = web resource|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavalier-Smith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: stasis and revolution |url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/0164755512w92302/fulltext.pdf |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |format = pdf |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969&amp;ndash;1006 |year=2006 |pmid=16754610|accessdate=2008-01-24 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding of evolutionary biology began with the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. In addition, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of [[genetics]]. This led to an understanding of the mechanisms of inheritance.&lt;ref name=gegme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Gregor_Mendel.html |title=Gregor Mendel|accessdate=2008-01-05 |last=Rhee|first=Sue Yon |year=1999 |work=Access Excellence |publisher=National Health Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further discoveries on how genes mutate, as well as advances in [[population genetics]] explained more details of how evolution occurs. Scientists now have a good understanding of the origin of new species ([[speciation]]). They have observed the speciation process happening both in the laboratory and in the wild. This modern view of evolution is the principal theory that scientists use to understand life.

==Darwin's idea: evolution by natural selection==
{{details more|Common descent}}
Charles Darwin developed the idea that each species had developed from ancestors with similar features, and in 1838, he described how a process he called natural selection would make this happen.&lt;ref name=Confessions&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eldredge |first= Niles| authorlink= Niles Eldredge|url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/ |title=Confessions of a Darwinist |accessdate=2008-01-23|date= Spring 2006 |journal=The Virginia Quarterly Review |pages=32&amp;ndash;53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's idea of how evolution works relied on the following observations:&lt;ref name=wyhe/&gt;
*If all the individuals of a species reproduced successfully, the population of that species would increase uncontrollably.
*Populations tend to remain about the same size from year to year.
*Environmental resources are limited.
*No two individuals in a given species are exactly alike.
*Much of this variation in a population can be passed on to offspring.

{{Double image stack |left |Charles_Darwin_by_G._Richmond.jpg |Haeckel Orchidae.jpg| 150|[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of evolution by [[natural selection]]. |Darwin noted that orchids exhibited a variety of complex adaptations to ensure pollination; all derived from basic floral parts.}}
Darwin deduced that since organisms produce more offspring than their environment could possibly support, there must be a competitive struggle for survival - only a few individuals can survive out of each generation. Darwin realized that it was not chance alone that determined survival. Instead, survival depends on the traits of each individual and if these traits aid or hinder survival and reproduction. Well-adapted, or &quot;fit&quot;, individuals are likely to leave more offspring than their less well-adapted competitors. Darwin realized that the unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce could cause gradual changes in the population. Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce would accumulate over generations. On the other hand, traits that hinder survival and reproduction would disappear. Darwin used the term ''natural selection'' to describe this process.&lt;ref name = Geographic/&gt;

Natural selection is commonly equated with ''survival of the fittest'', but this expression originated in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Biology'' in 1864, after Charles Darwin published his original works. ''Survival of the fittest'' describes the process of natural selection incorrectly, because natural selection is not only about survival and it is not always the fittest that survives.&lt;ref&gt;Futuyma, D. J. (2005). The Nature of Natural Selection. Ch. 8, pages 93-98 in Cracraft, J. and Bybee R. W. (Eds.) Evolutionary Science and Society: Educating a New Generation. American Institute of Biological Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Observations of variations in animals and plants formed the basis of the theory of natural selection. For example, Darwin observed that [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[insect]]s have a close relationship that allows the [[pollination]] of the plants. He noted that orchids have a variety of structures that attract insects - so that pollen from the flowers gets stuck to the insects’ bodies. In this way, insects transport the pollen from a male to a female orchid. In spite of the elaborate appearance of orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that make up other flowers. In ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' Darwin proposed that the orchid flowers did not represent the work of an ideal engineer, but were adapted from pre-existing parts, through natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_FertilisationofOrchids.html |title=Fertilisation of Orchids |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Wyhe |first=John van|year=2002 |work=The Complete Works of Charles Darwin|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural selection when he received a letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Alfred Wallace]] describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life like a [[family tree]], with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all life must be descended from a few forms, or even from a single common ancestor. He called this process, &quot;descent with modification&quot;.&lt;ref name=wyhe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html |title=Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist|accessdate=2008-01-16 |last= Wyhe |first= John van |coauthors= |year=2002 |work= The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online |publisher= University of Cambridge }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859. His theory means that all life, including humanity, is a product of continuing natural processes. The implication that all life on earth has a common ancestor has met with [[Objections to evolution| objections]] from some [[Creation-evolution controversy|religious groups]] who believe even today that the different types of life are due to [[special creation]].&lt;ref name=DeVries&gt;{{cite journal |author=DeVries A |title=The enigma of Darwin|journal=Clio Med|volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=136&amp;ndash;55|year=2004 |pmid=6085987|accessdate=2008-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by [[level of support for evolution|more than 99 percent]] of those within the [[scientific community]] today.&lt;ref name=delgado&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |title=Finding the Evolution in Medicine |accessdate=2007-12-21 |last= Delgado |first= Cynthia |year=2006 |work= NIH Record (National Institutes of Health)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of variation==


Darwin’s theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.&lt;ref name=toos&gt;{{harv|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108].}}  Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding was called the [[inheritance of acquired characters]] and was part of the theory of [[transmutation of species]] put forward in 1809 by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. In the late 19th century this theory became known as [[Lamarckism]]. Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called [[pangenesis]] to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s [[August Weismann|August Weismann's]] experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.&lt;ref name= ImaginaryLamarck&gt;{{citation |last =Ghiselin | first = Michael T.|authorlink=Michael T. Ghiselin | publication-date = September/October 1994| contribution =Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' | contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm| title =The Textbook Letter | publisher =The Textbook League | url =http://www.textbookleague.org/|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing information needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring was provided by the pioneering [[genetics]] work of [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilization. This is like mixing different hands of cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information ''factors''; however, they later became known as [[gene]]s. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.

Genes are made of [[DNA]], a long [[molecule]] that carries information. This information is encoded in the sequence of [[nucleotide]]s in the DNA, just as the sequence of the letters in words carries information on a page. The genes are like short instructions built up of the &quot;letters&quot; of the DNA alphabet. Put together, the entire set of these genes gives enough information to serve as an &quot;instruction manual&quot; of how to build and run an organism. The instructions spelled out by this DNA alphabet can be changed, however, by [[mutation]]s, and this may alter the instructions carried within the genes. Within the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], the genes are carried in [[chromosome]]s, which are packages for carrying the DNA, with the genes arranged along them like beads on a string. It is the reshuffling of the chromosomes that results in unique combinations of genes in offspring. 
[[Image:JamesDWatson.jpg|thumb|right|[[James D. Watson|James Watson]], co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]]]]

Although such mutations in DNA are random, natural selection is not a process of chance: the environment determines the probability of reproductive success. The end products of natural selection are organisms that are adapted to their present environments. Natural selection does not involve [[orthogenesis|progress towards an ultimate goal]]. Evolution does not necessarily strive for [[evolution of complexity|more advanced]], more intelligent, or more sophisticated life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Gould (a)|1981| p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[flea]]s (wingless parasites) are descended from a winged, ancestral [[Mecoptera|scorpionfly]], and snakes are lizards that no longer require limbs - although [[Python (genus)|python]]s still grow tiny structures that are the remains of their ancestor's hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bejder L, Hall BK |title=Limbs in whales and limblessness in other vertebrates: mechanisms of evolutionary and developmental transformation and loss |journal=Evol.

The most recent, the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]], occurred 65&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and has attracted more attention than all others because it killed the [[dinosaur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522&amp;ndash;42 | date=December 2004 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4067/is_200410/ai_n9458414/pg_1 |accessdate=2008-01-24 | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern synthesis==
{{details more|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}
The [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] was the outcome of a merger of several different scientific fields into a cohesive understanding of evolutionary theory. In the 1930s and 1940s, efforts were made to merge Darwin's theory of natural selection, research in heredity, and understandings of the fossil records into a unified explanatory model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12026&amp;page=10|title= The tangled web of biological science |accessdate=2008-01-06 |last= Committee on Defining and Advancing the Conceptual Basis of Biological Sciences |year=1989 |work= The role of theory in advancing 21st Century Biology:Catalyzing Transformation Research|publisher= National Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the principles of genetics to naturally occurring populations, by scientists such as [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst Mayr]], advanced understanding of the processes of evolution. Dobzhansky's 1937 work ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' was an important step in bridging the gap between genetics and field biology. Mayr, on the basis of an understanding of genes and direct observations of evolutionary processes from field research, introduced the biological species concept, which defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that are reproductively isolated from all other populations. The paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] helped to incorporate fossil research, which showed a pattern consistent with the branching and non-directional pathway of evolution of organisms predicted by the modern synthesis.

The modern synthesis emphasizes the importance of populations as the unit of evolution, the central role of natural selection as the most important mechanism of evolution, and the idea of gradualism to explain how large changes evolve as an accumulation of small changes over long periods of time.

==Evidence for evolution==
[[Image:Glyptodon-Armadillo.jpg|right|thumb|200px| During the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']], naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] collected fossils in [[South America]], and found fragments of armor which he thought were like giant versions of the scales on the modern [[armadillo]]s living nearby. On his return, the anatomist [[Richard Owen]] showed him that the fragments were from gigantic extinct [[glyptodon]]s, related to the armadillos. This was one of the patterns of distribution that helped Darwin to 
[[Inception of Darwin's theory#Geological début, species related to places|develop his theory]].&lt;ref name=Confessions/&gt;]] 
 
{{details more|Evidence of common descent}}

[[Scientific evidence]] for evolution comes from many aspects of [[biology]], and includes [[fossil]]s, [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] structures, and molecular similarities between species' [[DNA]].

===Fossil record===
Research in the field of [[paleontology]], the study of fossils, supports the idea that all living organisms are related. Fossils provide evidence that accumulated changes in organisms over long periods of time have led to the diverse forms of life we see today. A fossil itself reveals the organism's structure and the relationships between present and extinct species, allowing paleontologists to construct a family tree for all of the life forms on earth.&lt;ref name= Virtual&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fossilmuseum.net/fossilrecord.htm |title=The Fossil Record - Life's Epic |accessdate=2007-08-31 |work= The Virtual Fossil Museum |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern paleontology began with the work of [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769–1832). Cuvier noted that, in [[sedimentary rock]], each layer contained a specific group of fossils. The deeper layers, which he proposed to be older, contained simpler life forms. He noted that many forms of life from the past are no longer present today. One of Cuvier’s successful contributions to the understanding of the fossil record was establishing extinction as a fact. In an attempt to explain extinction, Cuvier proposed the idea of “revolutions” or [[catastrophism]] in which he speculated that geological catastrophes had occurred throughout the earth’s history, wiping out large numbers of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Tattersall|1995|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier's theory of revolutions was later replaced by uniformitarian theories, notably those of [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]] who proposed that the earth’s geological changes were gradual and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Lyell|1830| p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current evidence in the fossil record supports the concept of mass extinctions. As a result, the general idea of catastrophism has re-emerged as a valid hypothesis for at least some of the rapid changes in life forms that appear in the fossil records. 

A very large number of fossils have now been discovered and identified. These fossils serve as a chronological record of evolution. The fossil record provides examples of [[Transitional fossil|transitional species]] that demonstrate ancestral links between past and present life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=22 |title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism|accessdate=2008-01-06 |last=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|year=2008 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One such transitional fossil is ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', an ancient organism that had the distinct characteristics of a reptile (such as a long, bony tail and conical teeth) yet also had characteristics of birds (such as feathers and a wishbone). The implication from such a find is that modern reptiles and birds arose from a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Gould (b)|1995| p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br clear=left&gt;

===Comparative anatomy===
{{details more|Convergent evolution|Divergent evolution}}
The comparison of similarities between organisms of their form or appearance of parts, called their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], has long been a way to classify life into closely related groups. This can be done by comparing the structure of adult organisms in different species or by comparing the patterns of how cells grow, divide and even migrate during an organism's development.

;Taxonomy
[[Alpha taxonomy|Taxonomy]] is the branch of biology that names and classifies all living things. Scientists use morphological and genetic similarities to assist them in categorizing life forms based on ancestral relationships. For example, [[orangutan]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, and [[human]]s all belong to the same taxonomic grouping referred to as a family &amp;ndash; in this case the family called ''[[Great ape|Hominidae]]''. These animals are grouped together because of similarities in morphology that come from common ancestry (called ''homology'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Diamond|1992| p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Strong evidence for evolution comes from the analysis of ''homologous'' structures: structures in different species that no longer perform the same task but which share a similar structure.&lt;ref name= PBS&gt;{{citation| year =2001 | publication-date = | contribution =Glossary | contribution-url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/glossary/index.html| title =Evolution Library| publisher =WGBH Educational Foundation| url =http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat03.html|format = web resource|accessdate=2008-01-23| month =Jul| author =Drummond, A; Strimmer, K| volume =17| issue =7| pages =662–3| issn =1367-4803| pmid =11448888| journal =Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the case of the forelimbs of mammals. The forelimbs of a human, cat, whale, and bat all have strikingly similar bone structures. However, each of these four species' forelimbs performs a different task. The same bones that construct a bird's wings, which are used for flight, also construct a whale's flippers, which are used for swimming. Such a &quot;design&quot; makes little sense if they are unrelated and uniquely constructed for their particular tasks. The theory of evolution explains these homologous structures: all four animals shared a common ancestor, and each has undergone change over many generations. These changes in structure have produced forelimbs adapted for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Mayr|2001| pp=25&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

;Embryology
In some cases, anatomical comparison of structures in the [[embryo]]s of two or more species provides evidence for a shared ancestor that may not be obvious in the adult forms. As the embryo develops, these homologies can be lost to view, and the structures can take on different functions. Part of the basis of classifying the [[vertebrate]] group (which includes humans), is the presence of a [[tail]] (extending beyond the anus) and [[pharyngeal slit]]s. Both structures appear during some stage of embryonic development but are not always obvious in the adult form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Weichert|Presch|1975| p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the morphological similarities present in embryos of different species during development, it was once assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that human embryos passed through an [[amphibian]] then a [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]] stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a re-enactment, (often called ''[[Recapitulation theory]]''), is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, is that the first stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/embryos/Haeckel.html |title= Haeckel and his Embryos |accessdate=2007-09-02 |last= Miller |first= Kenneth |year=1997 |work= Evolution Resources |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[pharyngula|very early]] stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features emerge from this basic pattern.

;Vestigial structures
Homology includes a unique group of shared structures referred to as ''[[Vestigiality|vestigial structures]]''. ''Vestigial'' refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them. These apparently illogical structures are remnants of organs that played an important role in ancestral forms. Such is the case in [[whale]]s, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of [[Evolution of cetaceans|their ancestors]] which walked on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.toarchive.org/pdf/comdesc.pdf |format= pdf| title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution Part 2: Past History|accessdate=2008-01-27 |last= Theobald |first= Douglas |coauthors= |year=2004 |work= [[TalkOrigins Archive]]|publisher= The TalkOrigins Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have vestigial structures, including the [[Intrinsic muscles of external ear|ear muscles]], the [[wisdom teeth]], the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], the [[Coccyx|tail bone]], [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] (including [[goose bumps]]), and the [[Plica semilunaris of the conjunctiva|semilunar fold]] in the corner of the [[eye]].&lt;ref name= johnson&gt;{{citation |last= Johnson|first=George | year =2002 | publication-date = | contribution =Vestigial Structures | contribution-url =http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage12.html| title =The Evidence for Evolution| publisher = 'On Science' column in St. Louis Post Dispatch| url =http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/index.html |format = web resource|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Convergent evolution

Anatomical comparisons can be misleading, as not all anatomical similarities indicate a close relationship. Organisms that share similar environments will often develop similar physical features, a process known as ''[[convergent evolution]]''. Both [[shark]]s and [[dolphin]]s have similar body forms, yet are only distantly related &amp;ndash; sharks are [[fish]] and dolphins are [[mammal]]s. Such similarities are a result of both populations being exposed to the same [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]]. Within both groups, changes that aid swimming have been favored. Thus, over time, they developed similar appearances (morphology), even though they are not closely related.&lt;ref name= johnson2&gt;{{citation |last= Johnson|first=George | year =2002 | publication-date = | contribution = Convergent and Divergent Evolution| contribution-url = http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/Evolution/EVpage14.html| title =The Evidence for Evolution| publisher = 'On Science' column in St. Louis Post Dispatch| url =http://www.txtwriter.com/backgrounders/index.html |format = web resource|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular biology===
[[Image:DNA Overview.png|thumb|right|A section of [[DNA]]]]

Every living organism (with the possible exception of RNA [[virus]]es) contains molecules of DNA, which carries genetic information. [[Gene]]s are the pieces of DNA that carry this information, and they influence the properties of an organism. Genes determine an individual's general appearance and to some extent their behavior. If two organisms are closely related, their DNA will be very similar.&lt;ref name= NAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/evolution98/evol3.html |title= Teaching about evolution and the nature of science |accessdate=2007-12-30 |last= Kennedy |first=Donald |coauthors=(Working group on teaching evolution) |year=1998 |work=Evolution and the nature of science|publisher= The National Academy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the more distantly related two organisms are, the more differences they will have. For example, brothers are closely related and have very similar DNA, while cousins share a more distant relationship and have far more differences in their DNA. Similarities in DNA are used to determine the relationships between species in much the same manner as they are used to show relationships between individuals. For example, comparing [[chimpanzee]]s with [[gorilla]]s and humans shows that there is as much as a 96&amp;nbsp;percent similarity between the DNA of humans and chimps. Comparisons of DNA indicate that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either species is to gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html |title=Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last= Lovgren |first= Stefan |coauthors= |date=2005-08-31 |work= National Geographic News |publisher= National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Carroll|Grenier|Weatherbee|2000| p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular systematics]] focuses on measuring the similarities in these molecules and using this information to work out how different types of organisms are related through evolution. These comparisons have allowed biologists to build a ''relationship tree'' of the evolution of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ciccarelli FD, Doerks T, von Mering C, Creevey CJ, Snel B, Bork P |title=Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5765 |pages=1283&amp;ndash;87 |year=2006 |pmid=16513982|accessdate=2008-01-24 |doi=10.1126/science.1123061}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have even allowed scientists to unravel the relationships between organisms whose common ancestors lived such a long time ago that no real similarities remain in the appearance of the organisms.

===Co-evolution===
[[Co-evolution]] is a process in which two or more species influence the evolution of each other. All organisms are influenced by life around them; however, in co-evolution there is evidence that genetically determined traits in each species directly resulted from the interaction between the two organisms.&lt;ref name= NAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/evolution98/evol3.html |title= Teaching about evolution and the nature of science |accessdate=2007-12-30 |last= Kennedy |first=Donald |coauthors=(Working group on teaching evolution) |year=1998 |work=Evolution and the nature of science|publisher= The National Academy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensively documented case of co-evolution is the relationship between ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'', a type of [[ant]], and the [[acacia]], a plant that the ant uses for food and shelter. The relationship between the two is so intimate that it has led to the evolution of special structures and behaviors in both organisms. The ant defends the acacia against [[Herbivory|herbivores]] and clears the forest floor of the seeds from competing plants. In response, the plant has evolved swollen thorns that the ants use as shelter and special flower parts that the ants eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Botany/pdf_hi/sctb-0013.pdf |format= pdf| title=Swollen-Thorn Acacias of Central America |accessdate=2007-08-31 |last= Janzen |first= Daniel |coauthors= |year=1974 |work= Smithsonian Contributions to Biology |publisher= Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such co-evolution does not imply that the ants and the tree choose to behave in an [[altruism|altruistic]] manner. Rather, across a population small genetic changes in both ant and tree benefited each. The benefit gave a slightly higher chance of the characteristic being passed on to the next generation. Over time, successive mutations created the relationship we observe today.

===Artificial selection===
[[Image:IMG013biglittledogFX wb.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The results of [[artificial selection]]: a [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and a [[Great Dane]].]]

''[[Artificial selection]]'' is the controlled breeding of domestic plants and animals. Humans determine which animal or plant will reproduce and which of the offspring will survive; thus, they determine which genes will be passed on to future generations. The process of artificial selection has had a significant impact on the evolution of domestic animals. For example, people have produced different types of dogs by controlled breeding. The differences in size between the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] and the [[Great Dane]] are the result of artificial selection. Despite their dramatically different physical appearance, they and all other dogs evolved from a few wolves domesticated by humans in what is now China less than 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2498669.stm |title=Origin of dogs traced |accessdate=2007-12-14 |last= McGourty |first= Christine |date=2002-11-22 |publisher= BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artificial selection has produced a wide variety of plants. In the case of [[maize]] (corn), recent genetic evidence suggests that domestication occurred 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago in central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scq.ubc.ca/transgene-escape-are-traditional-corn-varieties-in-mexico-threatened-by-transgenic-corn-crops/?|title=Transgene Escape: Are Traditioanl Corn Varieties In Mexico Threatened by Transgenic Corn Crops |accessdate=2007-12-14 |last= Hall |first= Hardy |publisher= Scientific Creative Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to domestication, the edible portion of the wild form was small and difficult to collect. Today ''The Maize Genetics Cooperation • Stock Center'' maintains a collection of more than 10,000&amp;nbsp;genetic variations of maize that have arisen by random mutations and chromosomal variations from the original wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu/mgc-info.php |title= The Maize Genetics Cooperation • Stock Center |accessdate=2007-12-19 |date=2006-06-21 |work= National Plant Germplasm |publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In artificial selection the new breed or variety that emerges is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and artificial selection the variations are a result of random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://home.comcast.net/~lifebook/evolve.html |title=Better Books by Trial and Error. |accessdate=2008-04-04 |last= Silverman |first= E. David |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilner A. |title=Darwin's artificial selection as an experiment|journal=Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci.|volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=26&amp;ndash;40|year=2006 |pmid=16473266 |accessdate=2008-01-24 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was based on these observations of the many varieties of [[domestic pigeon]]s arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.
==Species==

{{details more|Species|Speciation|Phylogenetics|}}

Given the right circumstances, and enough time, evolution leads to the emergence of new species. Scientists have struggled to find a precise and all-inclusive definition of ''species''. [[Ernst W. Mayr|Ernst Mayr]] (1904–2005) defined a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed naturally with one another to produce viable, fertile offspring. (The members of a species cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of ''other'' species).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Mayr|2001| pp=165&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr's definition has gained wide acceptance among biologists, but does not apply to organisms such as [[bacteria]], which reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]].

Speciation is the lineage-splitting event that results in two separate species forming from a single common ancestral population.&lt;ref name = Geographic/&gt; A widely accepted method of speciation is called ''[[allopatric speciation]]''. Allopatric speciation begins when a population becomes geographically separated.&lt;ref name= PBS/&gt; Geological processes, such as the emergence of mountain ranges, the formation of canyons, or the flooding of land bridges by changes in sea level may result in separate populations. For speciation to occur, separation must be substantial, so that genetic exchange between the two populations is completely disrupted. In their separate environments, the genetically isolated groups follow their own unique evolutionary pathways. Each group will accumulate different mutations as well as be subjected to different selective pressures. The accumulated genetic changes may result in separated populations that can no longer interbreed if they are reunited.&lt;ref name=Geographic&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0411/feature1/fulltext.html#top |title=Was Darwin Wrong?|accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Quammen |first=David |year=2004 |work= National Geographic Magazine |publisher=National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers that prevent interbreeding are either ''prezygotic'' (prevent mating or fertilization) or ''postzygotic'' (barriers that occur after fertilization). If interbreeding is no longer possible, then they will be considered different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/december/darwin.php?page=2 |title=The Evolution of Charles Darwin |accessdate=2007-08-31 |last= Sulloway |first= Frank J |month=December | year=2005 |work= Smithsonian Magazine |publisher= Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the process of speciation is slow, occurring over very long time spans; thus direct observations within human life-spans are rare. However speciation has been observed in present day organisms, and past speciation events are recorded in fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jiggins CD, Bridle JR |title=Speciation in the apple maggot fly: a blend of vintages? |journal=Trends Ecol.

The theory of evolution is widely accepted among the scientific community, serving to link the diverse specialty areas of biology.&lt;ref name=delgado/&gt; Evolution provides the field of biology with a solid scientific base. The significance of evolutionary theory is best described by the title of a paper by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900–1975), published in ''American Biology Teacher''; &quot;[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=NCSE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/9256_cans_and_cants_of_teaching_ev_2_13_2001.asp |title=NCSE Resource |accessdate=2008-01-01 |date=2001-02-13 |work=Cans and Can`ts of Teaching Evolution |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the theory of evolution is not static. There is much discussion within the scientific community concerning the mechanisms behind the evolutionary process. For example, the rate at which evolution occurs is still under discussion. In addition, there are conflicting opinions as to which is the primary unit of evolutionary change—the organism or the gene.  

===Rate of change===
Two views exist concerning the rate of evolutionary change. Darwin and his contemporaries viewed evolution as a slow and gradual process. Evolutionary trees are based on the idea that profound differences in species are the result of many small changes that accumulate over long periods. 

The view that evolution is gradual had its basis in the works of the geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797) and his theory called &quot;[[gradualism]]&quot;. Hutton's theory suggests that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to [[catastrophism]] which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. The paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1940–2002) developed a model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change over only a few thousand or million years, alternating with long periods of relative stability, a model called &quot;[[punctuated equilibrium]]&quot; which explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_opus200.html |title=Opus 200 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |last= Gould |first= Stephen Jay |year=1991 |work= Stephen Jay Gould Archive |publisher= Natural History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit of change===
A common [[unit of selection]] in evolution is the organism. Natural selection occurs when the reproductive success of an individual is improved or reduced by an inherited characteristic, and reproductive success is measured by the number of an individual's surviving offspring. The organism view has been challenged by a variety of biologists as well as philosophers. [[Richard Dawkins]] (born 1941) proposes that much insight can be gained if we look at evolution from the gene's point of view; that is, that natural selection operates as an evolutionary mechanism on genes as well as organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |title=Genic and Organismic Selection |journal=Evolution |volume=34 |issue=5|month=September | year=1980|pages= 825 |url= http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-3820%28198009%2934%3A5%3C825%3AGAOS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage|accessdate=2007-12-23 |doi=10.2307/2407990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', he explains: 

{{cquote|Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too are shuffled to oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over; they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Dawkins|1976| p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others view selection working on many levels, not just at a single level of organism or gene; for example, Stephen Jay Gould called for a hierarchical perspective on selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10518549&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ, Lloyd EA |title=Individuality and adaptation across levels of selection: how shall we name and generalize the unit of Darwinism? |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=96 |issue=21 |pages=11904&amp;ndash;9 |year=1999 |pmid=10518549 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.96.21.11904|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10518549 |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Several basic observations establish the theory of evolution, which explains the variety and relationship of all living things. There are genetic variations within a population of individuals. Some individuals, by chance, have features that allow them to survive and thrive better than their kind. The individuals that survive will be more likely to have offspring of their own. The offspring might inherit the useful feature.

Evolution is not a random process. While mutations are random, natural selection is not. Evolution is an inevitable result of imperfectly copying, self-replicating organisms reproducing over billions of years under the selective pressure of the environment. The outcome of evolution is not a perfectly designed organism. The outcome is simply an individual that can survive better and reproduce more successfully than its neighbors in a particular environment. Fossils, the genetic code, and the peculiar distribution of life on earth provide a record of evolution and demonstrate the common ancestry of all organisms, both living and long dead. Evolution can be directly observed in artificial selection, the selective breeding for certain traits of domestic animals and plants. The diverse breeds of cats, dogs, horses, and agricultural plants serve as examples of evolution.

Although some groups raise [[Objections to evolution|objections to the theory of evolution]], the evidence of observation and experiments over a hundred years by thousands of scientists supports evolution.&lt;ref name=DeVries/&gt; The result of four billion years of evolution is the diversity of life around us, with an estimated 1.75&amp;nbsp;million different species in existence today.&lt;ref name=Cavalier-Smith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enviroliteracy.org/article.php/58.html | title=How many species are there? |accessdate=2008-01-05 |last=Sedjo|first=Roger|year=2007 |publisher=Environmental Literacy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“The '''Epic of Evolution''' is the 14 billion year narrative of cosmic, planetary, life, and cultural evolution—told in sacred ways.

Eminent theologian John F. Haught writes that theology by accepting the Epic of Evolution can renew itself. Since Darwin presented his ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea| dangerous idea]]'', religion has mostly opposed or ignored the scientific narrative but now some theology is fully engaging it.&lt;ref&gt;John F.

==Background==
{{Quotefarm|date=May 2009}}
The term can be confusing to those not familiar with it as the terms epic, evolution and myth are usually used in ways different than as applied in the Epic of Evolution. Evolution generally refers to [[evolution|biological evolution]], but here it means a [[process(science)|process]] in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Polkinghorne, ''The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, ISBN 0802848850 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fy1-hnYDHGIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=One+can+only+speak+of+creation+as+a+process&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1]&lt;/ref&gt; in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form ([[emergence]]). It should not be ‘''biologized''’ as it includes many areas of science&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley - [http://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, ISBN 9004116958&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently than scientists do. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moran – What is Evolution, 1993  [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html]retrieved 4-07-09 &lt;/ref&gt;. The same applies to the use of the term ''theory'' as used in the theory of evolution (see references for [[Evolution as theory and fact]]).

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster [http://www.merriam-webster.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic – Brian Swimme interview [http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:ZUk1tmv3bsYJ:www.earthlight.org/interview26.html+Epic+of+Evolution+Society&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=105&amp;gl=us]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes – provide meaning for a maturing individual (an ''individuate'') and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Campbell in one of his interview [http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/212-living-dialogues/episodes/2712-michael-dowd-great-story-epic]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epic of Evolution is a systematic story that helps make sense of humanity’s place and purpose in the process that is the Universe. It marries objective scientific facts with the meanings provided by philosophy and the spirituality of religious belief. It is a vast topic and much has been written and debated about it. It offers two different but combined perspectives of the same reality. It tells the tale of the Cosmos in a methodical way but with a religious acceptance of it while addressing complexity, directionality, purpose, human psychology and survival of the most cooperative and compassionate beings. This epic tale helps some people to deepen their faith and to understand and appreciate other religions and philosophies. They may move from ''believing in God, to knowing God''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epicofevolution.com/celebrate.html Celebrating the Epic of Evolution]retrieved 4/15/09&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word &quot;[[myth]]&quot; in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines &quot;a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society.&quot; He suggests that the Greek term &quot;[[mythos]]&quot; would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this Epic of Evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?[http://www.science-spirit.org/printerfriendly.php?article_id=29]- retrieved 3-22-09&lt;/ref&gt; Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple nor easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world’s spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.&lt;ref&gt; William Grassie, Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) - page 6 of this ref- [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Science and Spirit]retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on the term and it has been used in a number of texts. These authors however at times have substituted synonyms such as: Evolutionary Epic ([[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson)]]), Universal Story ([[Brian Swimme]], [[John F. Haught]]), Great Story (Connie Barlow, [[Michael Dowd]]), Everybody’s Story ([[Loyal Rue]]), New Story ([[Thomas Berry]], [[Al Gore]]), Cosmic Evolution ([[Eric Chaisson]]) and epic of creation ([[Philip Hefner]])&lt;ref&gt;*Edward O.

[[Image:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|130px|left|E.O.Wilson]]
''‘Epic of evolution’ is a term that, within the past three years, has become the theme and title of a number of gatherings. It seems to have been first used by Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1978&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson coined the term ''‘evolutionary epic''’– Teilhard Perspective, Volume 30 #2 Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;‘The evolutionary epic,’. Wilson wrote in his book On Human Nature, ‘is probably the best myth we will ever have.’ Myth as falsehood was not the usage intended by Wilson in this statement. Rather, myth as a grand narrative that provides a people with a placement in time—a meaningful placement that celebrates extraordinary moments of a shared heritage. The epic of evolution is science translated into meaningful story”''.&lt;ref&gt;Connie Barlow - ''The Epic of Evolution: Religious and cultural interpretations of modern scientific cosmology''[http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 Science &amp; Spirit Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was not the first to use the term but his fame, he is a two-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction, prompted its usage as the morphed phrase epic of evolution. In later years he also used the newer term Epic of Evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Novacek | first = Michael J. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001 | url =http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html| title =Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson | format = | work = | publisher =CNN.com | accessdate =2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wilson explained that humans had a need for the Epic of Evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'' By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,ISBN 0791443922,&lt;/ref&gt;. He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way&lt;ref&gt; Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998 [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a  religious way if they elect to do so.&lt;ref&gt; Ursula Goodenough - Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), ISBN-10: 0195136292&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Phil Hefner_1997.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Philip Hefner]]
Dr. [[Philip Hefner]] is the former editor for ''[[Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science]]'', the leading journal{{Fact|date=May 2009}} of religion and science in the world. He uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common. ''“We are here to weave the spiritualities that are life-giving for our phase of the Epic of Evolution and for the next generation.”'' &lt;ref&gt;Classic Quotations - Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. Audrey R. Chapman says of him – ''Philip Hefner is perhaps the theologian who has grappled the most seriously and explicitly with the evolution of human nature. His approach to this topic, particularly in his work ‘The Human Factor’ is to sacralize the process of evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey R. Chapman - Unprecedented Choices: Religious Ethics at the Frontiers of Genetic Science, Fortress Press, 1999, ISBN 0800631811&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner writes that ''stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy''.  It is ''not  science; it is scientifically informed myth'', a myth driven by the ''refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose''. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a ''large space in the domaine of religion-and-science''&lt;ref&gt;Hefner - The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;. ''The evolutionary epic is not science; it is scientifically informed myth. We must be clear about this (…)When Wilson wrote that “the true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic,” he also understood and proposed that the epic be incorporated into mythic religious formulation'' (1978, 206–7). &lt;ref&gt; Zygon Editorial [http://www.zygonjournal.org/editorial_latest.html]retrieved 3-13-09&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:UrsulaG.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Goodenough]]
Biologist Dr. [[Ursula Goodenough]] makes frequent use of the term and uses it to extrapolate from the concept of evolution to a guiding belief for mankind. She writes in  Sacred Depths (Emerging Religious Beliefs) ''&quot;When the responses elicited by the Epic of Evolution are gathered together several religious principles emerge that I can believe, serve as a framework for a global Ethos&quot;''. She makes use of  Hefner’s weaving metaphor to title the Epic of Evolution the warp on which the welt, pattern, color and art of humanity is woven.  It is the story that beautifully anchors human nature and purpose to the planetary picture. Religious naturalism is a response to this tale that provides a deep and abiding spiritual awareness and morality&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough - ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'', Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, ISBN 0195126130&lt;/ref&gt;. For more comments on the Epic see [[Wikiquote:Ursula Goodenough|Goodenought quotes]]
[[Image:Michael Dowd.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Michael Dowd]]
Evolutionary evangelist and  Pentecostal minister [[Michael Dowd]] uses the term to help construct his viewpoint of ''evolution theology'' ([[theistic evolution]]). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of [[Religious Naturalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128 Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd is the author of ''Thank God for Evolution: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dowd  -   ''Thank God for Evolution: How the Marriage of Science and Religion Will Transform Your Life and Our World'' - Viking Adult (June 19, 2008), ISBN-10: 0670020451&lt;/ref&gt;. He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/book Thank God for Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd’s stance is similar to that of the position of the Catholic Church. A Vatican official has reaffirmed that evolution is not incompatible with faith &lt;ref&gt; Herald Tribune - Europe,  2008/09/16[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/16/europe/EU-Vatican-Evolution.php]retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;. Reuters on Sept 16, 2008 reported that the Church considered the theory of evolution compatible with the Bible and saw no reason why God may not have used such a natural process in creating mankind. The Catholic Church teaches ''‘theistic evolution''’ which accepts evolution as a valid scientific theory. &lt;ref&gt; VATICAN CITY (Reuters)[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSLG62672220080916] retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:LoyalRue.jpg |thumb|105 px |left|Loyal Rue]]
Dr.[[Loyal Rue]], recipient of two [[John Templeton Foundation]] fellowships, describes the Epic as ''“the biggest of all pictures”'', ''“the ultimate account of how things are”'', ''“the sprawling narrative of evolutionary events”'', “''the essential foundation for discussions about which things matter”'', ''“the unfolding drama”'' and ''&quot;humbles us before the magnitude and complexity of creation”''. In his Epilogue to ''Everybody's Story'', he explains that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it&lt;ref&gt; Loyal Rue - Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, ISBN 0791443922&lt;/ref&gt;.
Rue has a whole section on the Epic in his 2006 book ''Religion is not About God''. He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things - ''we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness- maximinized, biochemical systems''. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.&lt;ref&gt; Loyal Rue - ''Religion is not About God'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, ISBN-10: 0813539552&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Brian swimme.jpg|thumb|100 px |right|Swimme,PhD]]

Dr. [[Brian Swimme]], mathematical cosmologist  and author of several books dealing with cosmology, evolution and religion, sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe. It is an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman’s thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is ''‘definitely mythic’'' – it has the fundamental nature of being mythic.''“You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans.”''&lt;ref&gt; Center for the Story of the Universe [http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| I think that what E. O. Wilson is trying to suggest is that to be fully human, a person has to see that life has a heroic dimension (…) I think for the scientist, and for other people, it's a question of &quot;is the universe valuable? Is it sacred? Is it holy? Or is the human agenda all that matters?&quot; I just don't think we're that stupid to continue in a way that continues to destroy. I'm hopeful that the Epic of Evolution will be yet another strategy in our culture that will lead our consciousness out of a very tight, human-centered materialism. |10px|10px| - EarthLight Magazine 1997 – interview by Lauren de Boer}}

Dr. [[Gordon D. Kaufman]], Professor of Divinity (Emeritus) at Harvard University and a past president of the [[American Academy of Religion]], in a more theistic manner sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process referring to it as a relative new ''‘common creation story’''. He states - ''It is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward) as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing, coming into being, of new modes of reality''&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman  -  ''God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world'', Fortress Press, 1996, page 101-2, ISBN 0800629590 [http://books.google.com/books?id=uYKDqTUfshQC] retrieved 3-17-09&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his book, ''In the beginning—creativity'', he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution – a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences &lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman - ''In the beginning—creativity'', Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, ISBN 0800660935 [http://books.google.com/books?id=4wMcBvErCX0C]retrieved 3-17-09]&lt;/ref&gt;. It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as ''God's native tongue''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1634 evolutionary evangelist] retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

Hefner in the March 2009 edition of Zygon says the Epic of Evolution is the natural history story of the universe that zooms from a cosmic macro-story to the micro-story  life on the Earth&lt;ref&gt;Hefner - The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a process over billions of years in which entities change into different and usually more complex forms. The Epic is not a narrative poem but a series of happenings that form the proper subject for a kind of heroic story. It is a story with chapters that may cover decades, thousands, millions  or billions of years. It can run from a few chapters to a great many depending on how one wishes to sub-divide it. Due to the time frames involved, a [[Logarithmic timeline]] has some advantages over straight line ones.

Dr. [[Eric Chaisson ]], an American astrophysicist and science educator best known for his research, teaching and writing on the interdisciplinary science of cosmic evolution , sees a directionality to the Epic. He writes – ''From galaxies to snowflakes, from stars to planets to life itself, we are beginning to identify an underlying pattern penetrating the fabric of all the natural sciences- a sweeping encompassing view along the  ‘arrow of time’''&lt;ref&gt;Eric Chaisson  - ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006 page xii, ISBN 0231135602&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_future.html Arrow of Time]&lt;/ref&gt;. Author [[Robert Wright]] in ''[[Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny]]'' also agrees that the biological epic and human history have a direction, destiny or purpose. He uses [[game theory]] ([[zero-sum]] and [[non-zero sum]] games) to prove his point. 
&lt;ref&gt; Robert Wright – ''Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny'', Vintage Press, 2001, pages 7, 334, ISBN-0-679-75894-1&lt;/ref&gt;. These views point to ongoing and future chapters to the Epic of Evolution.

Professor David Christian, San Diego State University, organizes the epic of creation into eight ''thresholds''. Each threshold marks a time when something truly new appeared and forms never before seen began to arise. The story Christian relates has only been possible since the mid-1900 due to improved dating techniques. As he explains, this epic will continue to grow and change as scientists and historians accumulate new knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity, Course No. 8050  [http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/CourseDescLong2.aspx?cid=8050]retrieved 4-11-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future chapters==
[[File:Out of into deep space.png|thumb|150px|left|Future Chapter – Ways to Make Contact in Deep Space]]
Evolution of life on Earth is a fact substantiated by thousands of scientists. There is plenty of confirming evidence in the geological and biological records. &quot;''The word 'theory' does not belong in front of the word 'evolution'.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.tufts.edu/AnswersInScience/ Is Evolution a Fact?]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; The more proper term should be continuing ‘Epic’ rather than finalized ‘theory’. It is not a final tale but an on going saga. ''The scenario of cosmic evolution is a human invention. It’s a long and spectacular story, an evolutionary epic that includes the storyteller. Despite its 7 major epochs, this grand narrative was not handed to us on a stone tablet atop some mountain. The scientific community has gradually deciphered the story, is now telling it forthrightly, and continues to refine it as we learn more'' &lt;ref&gt;Tufts University - A Continuing Story [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_site_summary.html]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;.

''The Epic, after all, is a dynamic story not a static once-and-for-all narrative myth'' (Philip Hefner). [[Wright Center for Science Education]] at [[Tufts University]] in its Cosmic Evolution story (Epoch 8 – Future Evolution, Prospects for Human Survival and Alien Life) attempts to spell out what the future chapters may be (''The future is a tricky subject. To comment on it is to run the risk of saying nothing concrete. The future is especially troublesome to foresee when life is involved […] Claiming knowledge of the pathways along which cosmic evolution will proceed henceforth is akin to dabbling in science fiction. Nonetheless, it’s possible to examine certain boundary conditions that will likely influence, many of them adversely so, the future of life on Earth'') &lt;ref&gt;Future Chapters [http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_future.html  ]retrieved 3-09-09&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Humankind may have evolved in the past from universal matter, but our future is now largely in our own hands. Are we smart enough to adjust to this alteration in the evolutionary scenario? Are we wise enough to ensure our own survival? The destiny of human life on Earth will truly be a measure of our current intelligence''. And how we write these future chapters.

John Stewart author of ''Evolution's Arrow: The Direction of Evolution and the Future of Humanity'' writes: ''A completely new phase in the evolution of life on Earth has begun. It will change everything. In this new phase evolution will be driven intentionally, by humanity. The evolutionary worldview that emerges from an understanding of our role in the new phase has the potential to transform the nature of human existence.''&lt;ref&gt;INTENTIONAL EVOLUTION [http://www.evolutionarymanifesto.com/man.html]retrieved3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart summarizes the future arrow of evolution into four main areas:
*Intentional evolution
*Advancing evolution by organizing a cooperative global society
*Advancing evolution by enhancing evolvability
*The unique capacity of the evolutionary worldview to provide direction and purpose for humanity

In that the Epic of Evolution is the full comprehensive story of evolution, it is subject to the same if not more debates than have characterized the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hovind|2006}}, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of the Universe, life and humanity  between the proponents of evolution, backed by [[scientific consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;Martz &amp; McDaniel 1987, p. 23, Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science&lt;/ref&gt; and those who propose literal interpretations of ancient texts by [[Fundamentalist| religious fundamentalists]]. This clash goes beyond the field of [[evolutionary biology]] and  includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the [[evidence of evolution]] is overwhelming, and the consensus supporting the[[ modern evolutionary synthesis]] is nearly absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm | last = Delgado | first = Cynthia | title = Finding evolution in medicine | journal = NIH Record | volume = 58 | issue = 15 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 | language = english | format = hmtl }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dover_pg83&quot;&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

Dr.[[John Haught]],  Roman Catholic theologian, in his ''Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation'' suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being chanced by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers ''evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today'' and deplores that contemporary theology gets ''hung up'' in the creationism controversy.&lt;ref&gt; John F. Haught - ''Science and Religion: from conflict to conversation'', Paulist Press, 1995, page 69, ISBN 0809136066 [http://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC]&lt;/ref&gt; There are liberal congregations these days that may see the Epic of Evolution as a history about life and the Universe that is both scientific and sacred. The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence, giving Nature an inspiring beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'' - A sermon by Douglas Taylor [http://uubinghamton.org/sermons/17sep2006.html]retrieved 3-15-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Chaisson in his book, ''Epic of Evolution'', concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolution – ''a powerful and noble effort'' – may perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium
&lt;ref&gt;Eric Chaisson - ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006, page 442,
ISBN 0231135602 [http://books.google.com/books/columbia?hl=en&amp;vid=ISBN9780231135603&amp;q=epic+of+evolution&amp;x=13&amp;y=5#PPA442,M1]retrieved 3-23-09&lt;/ref&gt;. Not all of the Epic’s advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a ''‘narrative of mythic proportions''’ that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists that dispute this contending that this is a [[materialistic]] story of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley - [http://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm.

==Educational efforts==

Besides the many books, journals, and videos on the evolution epic that have been published in recent years, there have been numerous other educational efforts and teaching aids developed to promote awareness of it.&lt;ref&gt;Books, Journals and Videos on the Epic of Evolution [http://www.epicofevolution.org/resources.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]] held a conference on the Epic of Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iras.org/Past%20Conferences.html Past Conferences], [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] organized a conference on the Epic of Evolution as part of their program on Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Conferences/CF_1997_11_1214_epic.shtml American Association for the Advancement of Science - Epic of Evolution conference program]&lt;/ref&gt; In July of 1999, The Forum on Religion and Ecology with special support from the Center for Respect of Life and Environment sponsored a conference titled The Epic of Evolution and World Religions. It consisted of a small invitational gathering of scholars of the world’s religious traditions as well as a number of scientists and educators. It explored how the creation stories of the world’s religions intersect with or react to the epic of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;The Forum on Religion and Ecology [http://fore.research.yale.edu/events/archived/1999/1tberry.html Epic of Evolution and World Religions]retrieved 3-27-09/&lt;/ref&gt; An Evolutionary Epic conference was held in Hawaii in January of 2008. It was attended by scientists, artists, educators, and spiritual and religious leaders. The objective was to weave together many otherwise disparate areas of study into one coherent Epic of Evolution tale (a [[consilience]]).&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary Epic Conference [http://www.evolutionaryepic.org/EE%20Home.htm evolutionaryepic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of scientists, theologians, and artists whose purpose was to explore the meaning and implications of the Epic of Evolution formed the Epic of Evolution Society in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg|thumb|right|400px|According to [[Ray Kurzweil]], his [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic graph]] of 15 lists of [[paradigm shift]]s for key [[human history|historic]] events shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] trend. The lists' compilers include [[Carl Sagan]], [[Paul D. Boyer]], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[American Museum of Natural History]], and [[University of Arizona]].]]

The '''technological singularity''' is the theoretical future point which takes place during a period of [[accelerating change]] sometime after the creation of a [[superintelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[I. J. Good]] first wrote of an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;, suggesting that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect, they could improve their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers, and thus [[recursion|recursively]] augment themselves into far greater intelligences. The first such improvements might be small, but as the machine became more intelligent it would become better at becoming more intelligent, which could lead to an exponential and quite sudden growth in intelligence.

In 1993, [[Vernor Vinge]] called this event &quot;the Singularity&quot; as an analogy between the breakdown of modern [[physics]] near a [[gravitational singularity]] and the drastic change in society he argues would occur following an intelligence explosion. In the 1980s, Vinge popularized the concept in lectures, essays, and science fiction. More recently, some prominent technologists such as [[Bill Joy]], founder of Sun Microsystems, voiced concern over the potential dangers of Vinge's singularity.{{Harv|Joy|2000}} 

[[Robin Hanson]] proposes that multiple &quot;singularities&quot; have occurred throughout history, dramatically affecting the growth rate of the economy.  Like the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution]]s of the past, the technological singularity would increase [[economic growth]] between 60 and 250 times.  An innovation that allowed for the replacement of virtually all human labor could trigger this event.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun08/6274 |title= Economics Of The Singularity |accessdate=2008-09-11 |author= Robin Hanson |work=IEEE Spectrum Special Report: The Singularity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Futurist]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] argues that the inevitability of a technological singularity is implied by a long-term pattern of [[accelerating change]] that generalizes [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and which he argues will continue to other technologies not yet invented. 

==Intelligence explosion==
{{Harvtxt|Good|1965}} speculated on the consequences of machines smarter than humans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mathematician and author [[Vernor Vinge]] greatly popularized Good’s notion of an intelligence explosion in the 1980s, calling the creation of the first ultraintelligent machine ''the Singularity''. Vinge first addressed the topic in print in the January 1983 issue of ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine.{{Harvtxt|Vinge|1993}} contains the oft-quoted statement, &quot;Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly thereafter, the human era will be ended.&quot; Vinge refines his estimate of the time scales involved, adding, &quot;I'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.&quot;

Vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences, however created, will be able to enhance their own minds faster than the humans that created them. &quot;When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress,&quot; Vinge writes, &quot;that progress will be much more rapid.&quot; This [[feedback loop]] of self-improving intelligence, he predicts, will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period of time.

Most proposed methods for creating smarter-than-human or [[transhuman]] minds fall into one of two categories: [[intelligence amplification]] of human brains and [[artificial intelligence]]. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation are numerous, and include [[bioengineering|bio-]] and [[genetic engineering]], [[nootropic]] drugs, AI assistants, direct [[brain-computer interface]]s, and [[mind transfer]].

Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically [[seed AI]]) is the most popular option for organizations trying to advance the singularity, a choice addressed by {{Harvtxt|Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence|2002}}. {{Harvtxt|Hanson|1998}} is also skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once one has exhausted the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; of easy methods for increasing human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult to find.

It is difficult to directly compare [[silicon]]-based hardware with [[neuron]]s. But {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} notes that computer [[speech recognition]] is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude as powerful as the human brain.

One other factor potentially hastening the singularity is the ongoing expansion of the community working on it, resulting from the increase in scientific research within developing countries.

===Economic aspects===
Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of some technological advancement.  Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the [[Paleolithic]] era until the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  This new agricultural economy began to double every 900 years, a remarkable increase.  In the current era, beginning with the [[Industrial Revolution]], the world’s economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than in the agricultural era.  If the rise of superhuman intelligences causes a similar revolution, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun08/6274 |title= Economics Of The Singularity |accessdate=2008-09-11 |author= Robin Hanson |work=IEEE Spectrum Special Report: The Singularity }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Machines capable of performing most mental and physical tasks as well as humans would cause a rise in wages for the jobs at which humans can still outperform machines. However, a sudden proliferation of humanlike machines would likely cause a net drop in wages, as humans compete with robots for jobs. Also, the wealth of the technological singularity may be concentrated in the hands of only a few. These wealthy few would be those who own the means of [[mass production|mass producing]] the intelligent robot workforce.&lt;ref name=Hanson&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun08/6274 |title= Economics Of The Singularity |accessdate=2008-11-19 |author= Robin Hanson |work=IEEE Spectrum Special Report: The Singularity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential dangers===
Superhuman intelligences may have goals inconsistent with human survival and prosperity. AI researcher [[Hugo de Garis]] suggests AIs may simply eliminate the human race, and humans would be powerless to stop them.

{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} argues that unlike man, a computer based intelligence is not tied to any particular body, which would give it a radically different world view. In particular, a software intelligence would essentially be immortal and so have no need to produce independent children that live on after it dies. It would thus have no evolutionary need for love.

Other oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with [[molecular nanotechnology]] and [[genetic engineering]]. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of [[Bill Joy]]'s ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine article &quot;[[Why the future doesn't need us]]&quot;.{{Harv|Joy|2000}}

{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2002}} discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists [[superintelligence]] as a possible cause:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moravec (1992) argues that although [[superintelligence]] in the form of machines may make humans in some sense obsolete as the top intelligence, there will still be room in the ecology for humans.

[[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] proposed that research be undertaken to produce [[friendly artificial intelligence]] in order to address the dangers. He noted that if the first real AI was friendly it would have a head start on self-improvement and thus might prevent other unfriendly AIs from developing. The [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]] is dedicated to this cause. [[Bill Hibbard]] also addresses issues of AI safety and morality in his book ''[[Super-Intelligent Machines]]''. However,  {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}} notes that there is no direct evolutionary motivation for an AI to be friendly to man.

[[Isaac Asimov]]’s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] is one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI: 

# A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with either the First or Second Law.

The laws are intended to prevent artificially intelligent robots from harming humans. In Asimov’s stories, any perceived problems with the laws tend to arise as a result of a misunderstanding on the part of some human operator; the robots themselves are merely acting to their best interpretation of their rules. In the [[2004 in film|2004]] film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', a possibility is explored in which AI take complete control over humanity for the purpose of protecting humanity from itself. (The film was based loosely on Asimov's stories; the aspect of machines taking over bears closer resemblance to Capek's [[R.U.R.]], a play that was the first work ever to use the term ''robot''.) In 2004, the Singularity Institute launched an Internet campaign called ''3 Laws Unsafe'' to raise awareness of AI safety issues and the inadequacy of Asimov’s laws in particular. {{Harv|Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence|2004}}

Many [[Singularitarianism|Singularitarians]] consider nanotechnology to be one of the greatest dangers facing humanity. For this reason, they often believe [[seed AI]] (an AI capable of making itself smarter) should precede nanotechnology. Others, such as the [[Foresight Institute]], advocate efforts to create molecular nanotechnology, claiming nanotechnology can be made safe for pre-singularity use or can expedite the arrival of a beneficial singularity.

==Accelerating change==
[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Kurzweil writes that, due to [[paradigm shift]]s, a trend of exponential growth extends from [[integrated circuits]] to earlier [[transistor]]s, [[vacuum tube]]s, [[relay]]s and [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] computers.]]

{{main|Accelerating change}}
Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term &quot;singularity&quot; in the context of technological progress, {{Harvtxt|Ulam|1958}} tells of a conversation with [[John von Neumann]] about accelerating change:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Hawkins|1983}} writes that &quot;mindsteps&quot;, dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views, are accelerating in frequency as quantified in his mindstep equation. He cites the inventions of writing, mathematics, and the computer as examples of such changes.

[[Ray Kurzweil]]'s analysis of history concludes that technological progress follows a pattern of [[exponential growth]], following what he calls ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''. He generalizes [[Moore's Law]], which describes geometric growth in integrated semiconductor complexity, to include technologies from far before the integrated circuit.

Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will cross it. He predicts [[paradigm shift]]s will become increasingly common, leading to &quot;technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history&quot;.{{Harv|Kurzweil|2001}} Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, setting the date at 2045.{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005}} His predictions differ from Vinge’s in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge’s rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.

This leads to the conclusion that an artificial intelligence that is capable of improving on its own design is also faced with a singularity. This idea is explored by [[Dan Simmons]] in his novel ''[[Hyperion (novel)|Hyperion]]'', where a collection of artificial intelligences debate whether or not to make themselves obsolete by creating a new generation of &quot;ultimate&quot; intelligence.

The [[Acceleration Studies Foundation]], an educational non-profit foundation founded by [[John Smart (futurist)|John Smart]], engages in outreach, education, research and advocacy concerning accelerating change.{{Harv|Acceleration Studies Foundation|2007}} It produces the Accelerating Change conference at Stanford University, and maintains the educational site [http://www.accelerationwatch.com/ Acceleration Watch].

Presumably, a technological singularity would lead to a rapid development of a [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev Type I civilization]] where a Kardashev Type I civilization has achieved mastery of the resources of its home planet, Type II of its [[planetary system]], and Type III of its [[galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Zubrin, Robert, 1999, ''Entering Space - Creating a Spacefaring Civilization''&lt;/ref&gt; Given the fact that, depending on the calculations used, humans on Earth will reach 0.73 on the Kardashev scale by 2030 or sooner, a technological singularity between now and then would push us rapidly over that limit.

==Criticism==

Some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence while others do not rule out the possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|2000|p=xiv}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The truth is that human intelligence can never be replaced with machine intelligence simply because we are not ourselves &quot;thinking machines&quot; in the sense in which that term is commonly understood.{{Harvtxt|Hawking|1998}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people say that computers can never show true intelligence whatever that may be. But it seems to me that if very complicated chemical molecules can operate in humans to make them intelligent then equally complicated electronic circuits can also make computers act in an intelligent way. And if they are intelligent they can presumably design computers that have even greater complexity and intelligence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Modis]]&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Modis, [http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tmodis/TedWEB.htm Forecasting the Growth of Complexity and Change], ''Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change'', 69, No 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Huebner]]&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, Jonathan (2005) A Possible Declining Trend for Worldwide Innovation, ''Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change'', October 2005, pp. 980-6&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining. [[John Smart (futurist)|John Smart]] criticizes Huebner's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, John (September 2005), On Huebner Innovation, Acceleration Studies Foundation, http://accelerating.org/articles/huebnerinnovation.html, retrieved on 2007-08-07&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer [[clock speed]]s is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold.  Although clock speeds in the past were advertised as the main source of speed from a processor, that's no longer true.  Today's processors use the circuits for different, more efficient purposes than pushing raw clock speed.  For instance, a [[Intel Core i7|Core i7]] at 2 GHz is far more powerful than a [[Pentium 4]] at 4 GHz.

Others propose that other &quot;singularities&quot; can be found through analysis of trends in [[world population]], world GDP, and other indices. [[Andrey Korotayev]] and others argue that historical [[hyperbolic growth]] curves can be attributed to [[feedback loop]]s that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future.

In ''The Progress of Computing'', [[William Nordhaus]] argued that, prior to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of [[Moore's Law]] to 19th-century computers. {{Harvtxt|Schmidhuber|2006}} suggests differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change, and that such phenomena may be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions.

A recent study of patents per thousand persons shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact—as suggested by [[Joseph Tainter]] in his seminal ''The Collapse of Complex Societies''&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1988) &quot;The Collapse of Complex Societies&quot; (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;—a law of diminishing returns. The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850–1900, and has been declining since. The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a wide spread &quot;general systems collapse&quot;. [[Thomas Homer Dixon]] in ''[[The Upside of Down|The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization]]'' shows that the declining energy returns on investment has led to the collapse of civilizations.
[[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' also shows that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment, and the consumption of strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.

==Popular culture==
{{Trivia|date=March 2009}}
{{See also|List of fictional computers}}
While discussing the singularity's growing recognition, Vernor {{Harvtxt|Vinge|1993}} writes that &quot;it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact.&quot; In addition to his own short story &quot;Bookworm, Run!&quot;, whose protagonist is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment, he cites [[Greg Bear]]'s novel ''[[Blood Music]]'' (1983) as an example of the singularity in fiction. Vinge described surviving the singularity in his 1986 novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]''. Vinge later expanded the notion of the singularity to a galactic scale in ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992), a novel populated by transcendent beings, each the product of a different race and possessed of distinct agendas and overwhelming power.  In [[William Gibson]]'s 1984 novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', AIs capable of improving their own programs are strictly regulated by special &quot;Turing police&quot; to ensure they never exceed a certain level of intelligence, and the plot centers on the efforts of one such AI to circumvent their control. The 1994 novel ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'' features an AI that augments itself so quickly as to gain low-level control of all matter in the Universe in a matter of hours. A more malevolent AI achieves similar levels of omnipotence in [[Harlan Ellison]]'s short story ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' (1967). [[William Thomas Quick]]'s novels ''Dreams of Flesh and Sand'' (1988), ''Dreams of Gods and Men'' (1989), and ''Singularities'' (1990) present an account of the transition through the singularity; in the latter novel, one of the characters states that it is necessary for Mankind's survival that they achieve an integration with the emerging machine intelligences, or it will be crushed under the dominance of the machines – the greatest risk to the survival of a species reaching this point (and alluding to large numbers of other species that either survived or failed this test, although no actual contact with alien species occurs in the novels).

The singularity is sometimes addressed in fictional works to explain the event's absence. [[Neal Asher]]'s ''[[Gridlinked]]'' series features a future where humans living in the Polity are governed by AIs and while some are resentful, most believe that they are far better governors than any human. In the fourth novel, ''[[Polity Agent]]'', it is mentioned that the singularity is far overdue yet most AIs have decided not to partake in it for reasons that only they know. A flashback character in [[Ken MacLeod]]'s 1998 novel ''[[The Cassini Division]]'' dismissively refers to the singularity as &quot;the [[Rapture]] for nerds&quot;, though the singularity goes on to happen anyway.

Popular movies in which computers become intelligent and overpower the human race include ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]'', the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series, ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', and ''[[The Matrix (series)|The Matrix]]'' series. The television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' also explores these themes. 

[[Isaac Asimov]] expressed ideas similar to a post-Kurzweilian singularity in his short story ''[[The Last Question]]''. Asimov's future envisions a reality where a combination of [[strong artificial intelligence]] and [[post-human]]s consume the cosmos, during a time Kurzweil describes as when &quot;the universe wakes up&quot;, the last of his six stages of cosmic evolution as described in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''. Post-human entities throughout various time periods of the story inquire of the artificial intelligence within the story as to how [[Heat death of the universe|entropy death]] will be avoided. The AI responds that it lacks sufficient information to come to a conclusion, until the end of the story when the AI does indeed arrive at a solution, and demonstrates it by re-creating the universe, in godlike speech and fashion (&quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT! And there was light—&quot;), from scratch. Notably, it does so in order to fulfill its [[Three Laws of Robotics|duty]] to answer the humans' question.

[[St. Edward's University]] chemist [[Eamonn Healy]] discusses accelerating change in the film ''[[Waking Life]]''. He divides history into increasingly shorter periods, estimating &quot;two billion years for life, six million years for the hominid, a hundred-thousand years for mankind as we know it&quot;. He proceeds to human cultural evolution, giving time scales of ten thousand years for agriculture, four hundred years for the scientific revolution, and one hundred fifty years for the industrial revolution. Information is emphasized as providing the basis for the new evolutionary paradigm, with artificial intelligence its culmination. He concludes we will eventually create &quot;neohumans&quot; which will usurp humanity’s present role in scientific and technological progress and allow the exponential trend of accelerating change to continue past the limits of human ability.

Accelerating progress features in some science fiction works, and is a central theme in [[Charles Stross]]'s [[Accelerando (novel)|''Accelerando'']]. Other notable authors that address singularity-related issues include [[Karl Schroeder]], [[Greg Egan]], [[Ken MacLeod]], [[David Brin]], [[Iain M. Banks]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Tony Ballantyne]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Dan Simmons]], [[Damien Broderick]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Jacek Dukaj]], [[Nagaru Tanigawa]] and [[Cory Doctorow]]. 
In the episode &quot;[[The Turk (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|The Turk]]&quot; of ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'', John Connor mentions the singularity. The Terminator franchise is predicated on the concept of a human-designed computer system becoming self-aware and deciding to destroy humankind. It eventually achieves [[superintelligence]].

The feature-length documentary film ''[[Transcendent Man (film)|Transcendent Man]]'' is based on Ray Kurzweil and his book ''The Singularity Is Near''. The film documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal what he believes to be mankind's destiny.

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently discover new scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10211175-1.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, researchers at [[Cornell]] developed a computer program that extrapolated the laws of motion from a pendulum's swings.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/newtonai.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April09/NaturalLaws.ws.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe these are a step towards technological singularity.{{Who|date=April 2009}}{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{creationism2}}
The status of '''creation and evolution in public education''' can be the subject of substantial [[debate]] in [[legal]], [[political]], and [[religious]] circles. The situation ranges from countries not allowing teachers to discuss the [[evidence for evolution]] or the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], which is the [[scientific theory]] that explains [[evolution]], to allowing [[evolutionary biology]] to be taught like any other scientific discipline. 

While some religions do not have theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present form of life on Earth, there has been much conflict over this matter within the [[Abrahamic religions]], some adherents of which are vigorously opposed to the consensus view of the scientific community. Conflict with evolutionary explanations is greatest in [[Literal and figurative language|literal interpretations]] of religious documents, and resistance to teaching evolution is thus related to the popularity of these more literalist views.

In Western countries, the inclusion of evolution in science courses has been mostly uncontroversial, with the exception of parts of the [[United States]]. There, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has ruled the teaching of [[creationism]] as [[science]] in [[public schools]] to be unconstitutional. [[Intelligent design]] has been presented as an alternative explanation to evolution in recent decades, but it has also been ruled unconstitutional by a [[United States district court|lower court]].

==United States==
In the United States, creationists and proponents of evolution are engaged in a long-standing battle over the legal status of creation and evolution in the public school science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32444-2005Mar13.html Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early law===
Until the late 19th century, creation was taught in nearly all schools in the United States, often from the position that the [[biblical literalism|literal interpretation]] of the [[Bible]] is [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]. With the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution in the 1860s after being first introduced in 1859, and developments in other fields such as [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], [[public school]]s began to teach science that was [[theistic evolution|reconciled with Christianity]] by most people, but considered by a number of early [[Christian Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] to be directly at odds with the Bible.

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy]] brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of [[William Jennings Bryan]] several [[U.S. state|states]] introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution. By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and passed in some states, such as Tennessee. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws.  [[John T. Scopes]] accepted, and he taught his [[Tennessee]] class evolution in defiance of the [[Butler Act]]. The textbook in question was ''Hunter's Civic Biology'' (1914).

The trial was widely publicized by [[H. L. Mencken]] among others, and is commonly referred to as the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]].

Scopes was convicted; however, the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution.

When the case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the fine when the jury had been required to). Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the law was not in violation of the First Amendment. The Court held,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory.&quot;  Scopes v. State 289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interpretation of the [[Establishment clause]] up to that time was that Congress could not establish a particular religion as the ''State'' religion. Consequently, the Court held that the ban on the teaching of evolution did not violate the Establishment clause, because it did not establish one religion as the &quot;State religion.&quot;  As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/2:Context#Page 19 of 139]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BF07&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Forrest_Paper.pdf Understanding the Intelligent Design Creationist Movement: Its True Nature and Goals.] (pdf) A Position Paper from the Center for Inquiry, Office of Public Policy Barbara Forrest.

=== Modern legal cases ===
[[Image:Seal of the United States Supreme Court.svg|right|thumb|The Supreme Court of the United States has made several rulings regarding evolution in public education.]]
In 1967, the Tennessee public schools were threatened with another lawsuit over the Butler Act's constitutionality, and, fearing public reprisal, Tennessee's legislature repealed the Butler Act. In the following year, 1968, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in [[Epperson v. Arkansas]] that Arkansas's law prohibiting the teaching of evolution was in violation of the [[First Amendment]]. The Supreme Court held that the Establishment Clause prohibits the state from advancing any religion, and determined that the Arkansas law which allowed the teaching of creation while disallowing the teaching of evolution advanced a religion, and was therefore in violation of the 1st amendment Establishment clause. This holding reflected a broader understanding of the Establishment Clause: instead of just prohibiting laws that established a state religion, the Clause was interpreted to prohibit laws that furthered religion. Opponents, pointing to the previous decision, argued that this amounted to [[judicial activism]].

In reaction to the Epperson case, creationists in Louisiana passed a law requiring that public schools should give &quot;equal time&quot; to &quot;alternative theories&quot; of origin. The Supreme Court ruled in [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] that the Louisiana statute, which required creation to be taught alongside evolution every time evolution was taught, was unconstitutional.

The Court laid out its rule as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law 'respecting an establishment of religion.' The Court has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause. First, the legislature must have adopted the law with a secular purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion. [[Lemon v. Kurtzman]], 403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). State action violates the Establishment Clause if it fails to satisfy any of these prongs.&quot;  Edwards v. Aguillard 482 U.S. 578, *582-583, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2577 (U.S.La.,1987).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court held that the law was not adopted with a secular purpose, because its purported purpose of &quot;protecting [[academic freedom]]&quot; was not furthered by limiting the freedom of teachers to teach what they thought appropriate; ruled that the act was discriminatory because it provided certain resources and guarantees to &quot;creation scientists&quot; which were not provided to those who taught evolution; and ruled that the law was intended to advance a particular religion because several state senators that had supported the bill stated that their support for the bill stemmed from their religious beliefs.

While the Court held that creationism is an inherently religious belief, it did not hold that every mention of creationism in a public school is unconstitutional:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We do not imply that a legislature could never require that scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories be taught. Indeed, the Court acknowledged in Stone that its decision forbidding the posting of the Ten Commandments did not mean that no use could ever be made of the Ten Commandments, or that the Ten Commandments played an exclusively religious role in the history of Western Civilization. 449 U.S., at 42, 101 S.Ct., at 194. In a similar way, teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction. But because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to endorse a particular religious doctrine, the Act furthers religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.&quot;  Edwards v. Aguillard 482 U.S. 578, 593-594, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2583 (U.S.La.,1987)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as it is permissible to discuss the crucial role of religion in medieval European history, creationism may be discussed in a civics, current affairs, philosophy, or comparative religions class where the intent is to factually educate students about the diverse range of human political and religious beliefs. The line is crossed ''only'' when creationism is taught ''as science'', just as it would be if a teacher were to proselytize a particular religious belief.

===Movements to teach creationism in schools===

There continue to be numerous efforts to introduce creationism in US classrooms. One strategy is to declare that evolution is a religion, and therefore it should not be taught in the classroom either, or that if evolution is a religion, then surely creationism as well can be taught in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kent Hovind]], a prominent creationist, who states on his [http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67 web page] that &quot;''Students in tax-supported schools are being taught that [[Evolution as theory and fact|evolution is a fact]]. We are convinced that evolution is a religion masquerading as science and should not be part of any science curriculum.''&quot; and &quot;''It is my contention that evolutionism is a religious world view that is not supported by science, Scripture, popular opinion, or common sense. The exclusive teaching of this dangerous, mind-altering philosophy in tax-supported schools, parks, museums, etc., is also a clear violation of the First Amendment.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[Phillip E. Johnson]] began reading the scientific literature on evolution. This led to the writing of ''[[Darwin on Trial]],'' which examined the evidence for evolution from religious point of view and challenged the assumption that the only reasonable explanation for the origin of species must be a [[Philosophy of naturalism|naturalistic]] one, though [[science]] is defined by searching for natural explanations for phenomena. This book, and his subsequent efforts to encourage and coordinate creationists with more credentials was the start of the &quot;[[Intelligent design]]&quot; movement. Intelligent design asserts that there is evidence that life was created by an &quot;intelligent designer&quot; (mainly that the physical properties of an object are so complex that they must have been &quot;designed&quot;). Proponents claim that ID takes &quot;all available facts&quot; into account rather than just those available through naturalism. Opponents assert that ID is a [[pseudoscience]] because its claims cannot be tested by [[experiment]] (see [[falsifiability]]) and do not propose any new [[hypotheses]].

Many proponents of the ID movement support requiring that it be taught in the public schools. For example, conservative think-tank&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html Politicized Scholars Put Evolution on the Defensive - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, The [[Discovery Institute]] and Phillip E. Johnson, support the policy of &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot;, which entails presenting to students evidence for and against evolution, and then encouraging students to evaluate that evidence themselves.

While many proponents of ID believe that it should be taught in schools, other creationists believe that legislation is not appropriate.  [[Answers in Genesis]] has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;AiG is not a lobby group, and we oppose legislation for compulsion of creation teaching ... why would we want an atheist forced to teach creation and give a distorted view? But we would like legal protection for teachers who present scientific arguments against the sacred cow of evolution such as staged pictures of peppered moths and forged embryo diagrams ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2004/1201debate.asp Jason Lisle vs. Eugenie Scott on CNN!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Opponents point out that there is no ''scientific'' controversy, but only a political and religious one, therefore &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; would only be appropriate in a social studies, religion, or philosophy class. Many, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], compare teaching intelligent design in schools to teaching [[Flat Earth|flat earthism]], since the [[scientific consensus]] regarding these issues is identical. Dawkins has stated that teaching creationism to children is akin to [[child abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]], Bantam Press, 2006, ISBN 0593055489.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007 the [[Council of Europe]]'s &quot;Committee on Culture, Science and Education&quot; issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states &quot;Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes.&quot;&lt;ref name=coe_report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11297.htm|title=The dangers of creationism in education|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as &quot;anti-science&quot; and involving &quot;blatant scientific fraud&quot; and &quot;intellectual deception&quot; that &quot;blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science&quot; and links it and other forms of creationism to [[denialism]].

=== Recent developments in state education programs ===
{{seealso|Academic Freedom bills}}
====Alabama====
In 1996, the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] adopted a textbook sticker that was a disclaimer about evolution. It has since been revised and moderated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alscience.org/disclaimer.html Alabama Citizens for Science Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====

In August 2008 Judge Otero ruled in favor of [[University of California]] in [[Association of Christian Schools International v. Roman Stearns]] agreeing with the university's position that various religious books on U.S. history and science, from [[A Beka Book]]s and [[Bob Jones University Press]], should not be used for a college-preparatory classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/californian/murrieta/za3f1fe48ff6b8872882574a0000ff96d.txt | title=Judge throws out religious discrimination suit |publisher=[[North County Times]] | date=August 8, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was filed in spring 2006 by [[Association of Christian Schools International]] against the [[University of California]] claiming religious discrimination over the rejection of five courses as college preparatory instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/acsi-stearns/ruling0808.pdf | title=Association of Christian Schools International et al. v.

====Kansas====
On [[August 11]], [[1999]], by a 6–4 vote the [[Kansas]] State Board of Education changed their [[science education]] standards to remove any mention of &quot;biological macroevolution, the age of the Earth, or the origin and early development of the Universe&quot;, so that evolutionary theory no longer appeared in state-wide standardized tests and &quot;it was left to the 305 local school districts in Kansas whether or not to teach it.&quot;&lt;ref name=AGI&gt;[http://www.agiweb.org/gap/legis106/evolution.html AGI Update on Challenges to the Teaching of Evolution (3-18-01)]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was hailed by creationists, and sparked a statewide and nationwide controversy with scientists condemning the change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/08/creationism.vs.evolution CNN.com Evolution-creation debate grows louder with Kansas controversy]&lt;/ref&gt; Challengers in the state's Republican primary who made opposition to the anti-evolution standards their focus were voted in on [[August 1]], [[2000]], so on [[February 14]], [[2001]], the Board voted 7–3 to reinstate the teaching of biological evolution and the origin of the earth into the state's science education standards.&lt;!--can't see this next bit in the reference! reversed its decision and rejected a compromise on [[Intelligent Design]] put forward by the creationist backers of the original [[1999]] decision.--&gt;&lt;ref name=AGI/&gt;

In 2004 Kansas Board of Education elections gave religious conservatives a majority and, influenced by the [[Discovery Institute]], they arranged the [[Kansas evolution hearings]]. On [[August 9]], [[2005]], the Kansas State Board of Education drafted new &quot;science standards that require critical analysis of evolution – including scientific evidence refuting the theory,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://headlines.agapepress.org/archive/8/112006d.asp News from Agape Press]&lt;/ref&gt; which opponents analyzed as effectively stating that intelligent design should be taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/the_kansas_stan.html The Kansas standards DO include ID]&lt;/ref&gt; The new standards also provide a definition of science that does not preclude supernatural explanations, and were approved by a 6-4 vote on [[November 8]], [[2005]] – the same day, interestingly, on which the Dover school board members were voted out (see above).

In Kansas' state Republican primary elections on [[August 1]], [[2006]], moderate Republicans took control away from the anti-evolution conservatives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/15175001.htm AP Wire | 08/02/2006 | Conservatives lose majority on State Board of Ed]&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an expectation that science standards which effectively embraced intelligent design and cast doubt on Darwinian evolution would now be changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/05/AR2006080500718.html Nothing Wrong With Kansas]&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[February 13]], [[2007]], the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum which removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science. In the words of Dr Bill Wagnon, the board chairman, &quot;Today the Kansas Board of Education returned its curriculum standards to mainstream science&quot;. The new curriculum, as well as a document outlining the differences with the previous curriculum, has been posted on the Kansas State Department of Education's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksde.org/Default.aspx?tabid=144 Kansas Curricular Standards for Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kentucky====
In October 1999, the [[Kentucky]] Department of Education replaced the word &quot;evolution&quot; with &quot;change over time&quot; in state school standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/08/creationism.vs.evolution CNN.com - Evolution-creation debate grows louder with Kansas controversy - March 8, 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Ohio====
In 2002, proponents of intelligent design asked the [[Ohio]] Board of Education to adopt intelligent design as part of its standard biology curriculum, in line with the guidelines of the Edwards v. Aguillard holding. In December 2002, the Board adopted a proposal that permitted, but did not require, the teaching of intelligent design.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

====Georgia====
In 2002, six parents in [[Cobb County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the case [[Selman v. Cobb County School District]] sued to have the following sticker removed from public school textbooks: &quot;This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.&quot; ''Selman v. Cobb County School District'', No. 1:02CV2325 (N.D. Ga. filed [[August 21]], [[2002]]). Defense attorney Gunn said, &quot;The only thing the school board did is acknowledge there is a potential conflict [between evolution and creationism] and there is a potential infringement on people's beliefs if you present it in a dogmatic way. We're going to do it in a respectful way.&quot; Gerald R. Weber, legal director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] of Georgia, said &quot;The progress of church-state cases has been that the [U.S.] Supreme Court sets a line, then government entities do what they can to skirt that line. ... Here the Supreme Court has said you can't teach creationism in the public schools. You can't have an equal-time provision for evolution and creationism. These disclaimers are a new effort to skirt the line.&quot; Jefferey Selman, who brought the lawsuit, claims &quot;It singles out evolution from all the scientific theories out there. Why single out evolution?  It has to be coming from a religious basis, and that violates the separation of church and state.&quot; The School Board said it adopted the sticker &quot;to foster critical thinking among students, to allow academic freedom consistent with legal requirements, to promote tolerance and acceptance of diversity of opinion and to ensure a posture of neutrality toward religion.&quot;

On [[January 14]], [[2005]], a federal judge in Atlanta ruled that the stickers should be removed as they violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/ID/6822028/ Judge nixes evolution textbook stickers - Science - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The school board subsequently decided to appeal the decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/search/content/auto/epaper/editions/today/news_14ce5b3b4491d02d0025.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2005/0120cobb.asp The sticker didn't stick (or did it?)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In comments on [[December 15]], [[2005]] in advance of releasing its decision, the appeal court panel appeared critical of the lower court ruling and a judge indicated that he did not understand the difference between evolution and [[abiogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/942395631.html?dids=942395631:942395631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+16%2C+2005&amp;author=Ellen+Barry&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.22&amp;desc=THE+NATION%3B+Appeals+Panel+Criticizes+Evolution+Ruling%3B+A+federal+district+judge+had+ordered+the+removal+of+stickers+in+a+Georgia+county%27s+science+textbooks+that+called+evolution+a+theory.

On [[December 20]], [[2006]], the [[Cobb County]] Board of Education abandoned all of its legal activities and will no longer mandate that biology texts contain a sticker stating &quot;evolution is a theory, not a fact.&quot;  Their decision was a result of compromise negotiated with a group of parents, represented by the [[ACLU]], that were opposed to the sticker. The parents agreed, as their part of the compromise, to withdraw their legal actions against the board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-na-evolution20dec20,1,1277638.story?coll=la-news-learning&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
In 2004 the [[Dover, Pennsylvania]] School Board voted that a statement must be read to students of 9th grade biology mentioning Intelligent Design. This resulted in a firestorm of criticism from scientists and science teachers and caused a group of parents to begin legal proceedings (sometimes referred to as the [[Dover panda trial]]) to challenge the decision, based on their interpretation of the [[Edwards v. Aguillard|Aguillard]] precedent. Supporters of the school board's position noted that the Aguillard holding explicitly allowed for a variety of what they consider &quot;scientific theories&quot; of origins for the secular purpose of improving scientific education. Others have argued that Intelligent Design should not be allowed to use this &quot;loophole.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dorf/20041222.html FindLaw's Writ - Dorf: Why It's Unconstitutional to Teach &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; in the Public Schools, as an Alternative to Evolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[November 8]] [[2005]], the members of the school board in Dover were voted out and replaced by evolutionary theory supporters.

We have concluded that it is not, and moreover that ID cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents.&quot;

====Virginia====

Despite proponents urging that intelligent design should be included in the school system's science curriculum the school board of [[Chesterfield County Public Schools]] in [[Virginia]] decided on [[May 23]], [[2007]], to approve science textbooks for middle and high schools which do not include the idea of intelligent design. However, during the board meeting a statement was made that their aim was self-directed learning which &quot;occurs only when alternative views are explored and discussed&quot;, and directed that professionals supporting curriculum development and implementation are to be required &quot;to investigate and develop processes that encompass a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning&quot; of the theory of evolution, &quot;along with all other topics that raise differences of thought and opinion.&quot; During the week before the meeting, one of the intelligent design proponents claimed that &quot;Students are being excluded from scientific debate. It's time to bring this debate into the classroom&quot;, and presented &quot;[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmond.com/education/output.aspx?Article_ID=4707910&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=5 ''Evolution vs. Intelligent Design: Chesterfield School Board takes up debate on different theories of life''], Donna C.

====Texas====

On [[November 7]], [[2007]] the [[Texas Education Agency]] director of science curriculum [[Christine Comer]] was forced to resign over an e-mail she had sent announcing a talk given by an anti-Intelligent Design author. In a memo obtained under the Texas Freedom of Information act, TEA officials wrote &quot;Ms. Comer's e-mail implies endorsement of the speaker and implies that TEA endorses the speaker's position on a subject on which the agency must remain neutral.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/11/29/1129science.html News Release], State science curriculum director resigns, [[November 29]], [[2007]], Retrieved [[2007-12-13]]&lt;/ref&gt; In response over 100 biology professors from Texas universities signed a letter to the state education commissioner denouncing the requirement to be neutral on the subject of Intelligent Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/5367760.html News Release], Texas biology professors voice support for evolution education, [[December 11]], [[2007]], Retrieved [[2007-12-13]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====

On February 19, 2008, the [[Florida]] State Board of Education adopted new science standards in a 4-3 vote. The new science curriculum standards explicitly require the teaching of the &quot;scientific theory of evolution&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/02/evolution-wins.html |title=Evolution Wins as Creationists (Accidentally) Switch Sides in Florida | Wired Science from Wired.com |accessdate=2008-02-20 |format= |work=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the previous standards only referenced evolution using the words &quot;change over time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4311046&amp;page=1 News Release], Science Standards Will Call Evolution 'Scientific Theory', [[February 19]], [[2008]], Retrieved [[2008-02-19]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent polls===
In 2000, a [[People for the American Way]] poll among Americans found that:
*29% believe public schools should teach evolution in science class but can discuss [[creationism]] there as a belief;
*20% believe public schools should teach evolution only;
*17% believe public schools should teach evolution in science class and religious theories elsewhere;
*16% believe public schools should teach creation only;
*13% believe public schools should teach both evolution and creationism in science class;
*4% believe public schools should teach both but are not sure how.

In 2006, a poll taken over the telephone by [[Zogby]] International commissioned by the [[Discovery Institute]] found that more than three to one of voters surveyed chose the option that biology teachers should teach Darwin's theory of evolution, but also &quot;the scientific evidence against it&quot;. Approximately seven in ten (69%) sided with this view. In contrast, one in five (21%) chose the other option given, that biology teachers should teach only Darwin's theory of evolution and the scientific evidence that supports it. One in ten was not sure. The poll's results are often regarded as worthless however, because the wording of the poll question implies that significant &quot;scientific evidence&quot; against evolution actually exists to be taught (see [[push poll]]ing) - a proposition with which less than 0.15% of scientists with relevant expertise would agree.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=719&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
{{POV|date=November 2008}}

Over the past few years, there have been several attempts to undermine the teaching of evolution in public schools. Tactics include claims that evolution is &quot;[[merely a theory]]&quot;, which exploits the difference between the general use of the word [[theory]] and the [[theory#Science|scientific usage]], and thus insinuates that evolution does not have widespread acceptance amongst scientists; promoting the teaching of alternative [[pseudoscience]]s such as [[intelligent design]]; and completely ignoring [[evolution]] in biology classes. In general, these controversies, at the local school district level, have resulted in Federal and State court actions (usually by parents who are opposed to teaching of religion in school).   There has been a number of consequences of these activities:

*The teaching of religious doctrines, such as [[Creation Science]] and [[Intelligent Design]], relies upon an understanding of and belief in the supernatural. This is in direct opposition to the principle that science can only use natural, reproducible, testable forces to explain phenomena. This could lead to the disabling of students' abilities to develop the critical thinking skills necessary for all scientists.
*The costs to school districts to defend their actions in imposing religious teaching over the science of evolution are high, diverting funds that the districts could use for the education of their students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/taking-action/theory-not-fact-policies-whats-wrong What’s Wrong with ‘Theory Not Fact’ Resolutions], National Center for Science Education, December 7, 2000, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseweb.org/news/2006/02/intelligent-design-costs-dover-over-1000000-00899 &quot;'Intelligent Design' Costs Dover School District Over $1 million&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lack of proper science education will have a long-term effect of eroding the technological leadership of the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionbioscience.org/education/berra.html ''Separating Religious Fundamentalist &quot;Science&quot; from Science''], from ''Evolution and the Myth of Creationism'', Tim Berra, Stanford University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Most biology and medical research institutions assume a well-grounded undergraduate education in biology, which includes the study of evolution. Since modern medical research has focused on the cellular and biochemical levels, the knowledge that all of these processes have evolved from a common ancestor and the processes are remarkably similar between diverse species will be critical in designing experiments to test novel treatments for disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5787&amp;page=1 Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Christine Comer]], the Director of Science Curriculum for [[Texas]], resigned after being placed on administrative leave for a breach of [[Texas Education Agency]] policy, which requires a neutral stance regarding ID and evolution. Ms. Comer had forwarded an email containing details of an upcoming talk by [[Barbara Forrest]], an expert on the history of the ID movement who had been an expert witness on that subject in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], and a prominent critic of ID. [[Lizzette Reynolds]], formerly of the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and also deputy legislative director for former Texas Governor, [[George W. Bush]], emailed Comer's supervisor: &quot;This is highly inappropriate,&quot; Reynolds said. &quot;I believe this is an offense that calls for termination or, at the very least, reassignment of responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/11/29/1129science.html State science curriculum director resigns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. legal quotations===
[[Image:Judgejohnjones.jpg|thumb|right|Judge [[John E. Jones III]] made a landmark ruling in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]
The Supreme Court, [[Epperson v. Arkansas]] (1968):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“...the First Amendment does not permit the state to require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma...the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[McLean v. Arkansas]] case (1982), the judge wrote that creation scientists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“...cannot properly describe the methodology used as scientific, if they start with a conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court, [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] (1987):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“...Because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to advance a particular religious belief, the Act endorses religion in violation of the First Amendment.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Webster v. New Lenox School District]] (1990), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“If a teacher in a public school uses religion and teaches religious beliefs or espouses theories clearly based on religious underpinnings, the principles of the separation of church and state are violated as clearly as if a statute ordered the teacher to teach religious theories such as the statutes in Edwards did.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 9th Circuit Federal Appeals Court wrote in a California case ([[Peloza v. Capistrano School District]], 1994):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The Supreme Court has held unequivocally that while belief in a Divine Creator of the universe is a religious belief, the scientific theory that higher forms of life evolved from lower ones is not.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

United States District Court Judge John E. Jones III stated thus in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]], 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We have concluded that Intelligent Design is not science, and moreover that I.D. cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious antecedents.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Europe==
===Council of Europe's resolution 1580===
October 4 2007, The [[Council of Europe]] released the 'Provisional edition' of resolution 1580: The dangers of creationism in education. The resolution rejects that creationism in any form, including &quot;intelligent design&quot;, can be considered scientific (Article 4), though recommends its inclusion in religion and cultural classes (Article 16). The resolution concludes that teaching creationism in school as a scientific theory may threaten civil rights (Articles 13 and 18). The resolution summarizes itself in Article 19:&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta07/ERES1580.htm Provisional edition of resolution 1580, October 4 2007], [[Council of Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
The Parliamentary Assembly therefore urges the member states, and especially their education authorities to:
#defend and promote scientific knowledge;
#strengthen the teaching of the foundations of science, its history, its epistemology and its methods alongside the teaching of objective scientific knowledge;
#make science more comprehensible, more attractive and closer to the realities of the contemporary world;
#firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion;
#promote the teaching of evolution as a fundamental scientific theory in the school curriculula.}}

===United Kingdom===
In each of the countries of the [[United Kingdom]], there is an agreed syllabus for [[religious education]] with the right of parents to withdraw their children from these lessons. The religious education syllabus does not involve teaching creationism, but rather teaching the central tenets of major world faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/13989.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2002: United Kingdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the teaching of evolution is compulsory in publicly funded schools. For instance, the National Curriculum for England requires that students at Key Stage 4 (14-16) be taught:
# that the fossil record is evidence for evolution
# how variation and selection may lead to evolution or to extinction.

Similar requirements exist in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

In 2003 the [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]] (previously the Vardy Foundation after its founder, [[Peter Vardy (businessman)|Sir Peter Vardy]]) sponsored a number of &quot;faith-based&quot; academies where evolution and creationist ideas would be taught side-by-side in science classes. This caused a considerable amount of controversy.

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]], leader of the [[Church of England]], has expressed his view that creationism should not be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html Transcript: Rowan Williams interview | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4828238.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Education | Fears over teaching creationism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation calling itself [[Truth in Science]] has distributed teaching packs of creationist information to schools, and claims that fifty-nine schools are using the packs as &quot;a useful classroom resource&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1957858,00.html Revealed: rise of creationism in UK schools]&lt;/ref&gt; The government has stated that  &quot;Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum. The Truth in Science information pack is therefore not an appropriate resource to support the science curriculum.&quot; It is arranging to communicate this message directly to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/publicservices/story/0,,1965988,00.html Ministers to ban creationist teaching aids in science lessons]&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts to introduce creationism and intelligent design into schools in the UK is being opposed by an organization called the [[British Center for Science Education]].

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] some factions teach creationism in their own schools. In May 2005, Delft University of Technology physicist and author of a book on Intelligent Design [[Cees Dekker]] convinced education minister [[Maria van der Hoeven]] that debate about Intelligent Design may encourage discourse between the country's various religious parties. She then sought to &quot;stimulate an academic debate&quot; on the subject.

During 2007, Turkish creationist [[Harun Yahya]] sent his book ''The Atlas of Creation'' to a large number of European, including [[Denmark|Danish]], schools.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

On April 25 2007, Member of Parliament Martin Henriksen (Danish People's Party) asked Minister of Education Bertel Haarder (The Liberal Party) for information about how many educational institutions had received ''The Atlas of Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folketinget.dk/doc.aspx?/Samling/20061/spoergsmaal/S4310/svar/endeligt/20070508/index.htm Question from Member of Parliament Martin Henriksen (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; The minister responded that the Ministry of Education was not in possession of information about the number of educational institutions that had received the book, that choice of educational material was not up to the ministry, and that it is an objective of the discipline biology in primary school that the education must enable the pupils to relate to values and conflicts of interest connected with issues with a biological content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folketinget.dk/samling/20061/spoergsmaal/S4310/svar/endeligt/20070508/372118.HTM Response from Minister of Education Bertel Haarder (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11 2007, following the October 4 release of the [[#Council_of_Europe.27s_resolution_1580|Council of Europe's resolution 1580]], Danish member of [[ISKCON]] and leading ID-proponent Leif Asmark Jensen published a letter on his website. The letter is addressed to &quot;Danish politicians&quot; and is a clarification why Asmark and other ID-proponents consider the resolution &quot;so problematic that the Danish Parliament ought to ignore the resolution and maintain the Danish tradition for openness in school education.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligentdesign.dk/readarticle.php?article_id=14 Leif Asmark Jensen's letter to Danish politicians (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In interview sessions during 2002, less than 10% of the interviewed Danes declared the theory of evolution false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/313/5788/765/DC1/1 interview sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[Poland]] saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006 when the deputy education minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as &quot;one of many lies&quot; taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, &quot;as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory.&quot; Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that &quot;dinosaurs and humans co-existed because Poles remember the [[Smok Wawelski|Wawel Dragon]] and Scots knows about the [[Loch Ness Monster|Loch Ness monster]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj And finally...]&quot;, Warsaw Business Journal, 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
In [[Eastern Europe]], [[Serbia]] suspended the teaching of evolution for one week in 2004, under education minister [[Ljiljana Čolić]], only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/09/wdarw09.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/09/ixworld.html Darwin is off the curriculum for Serbian schools]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties&quot; says the BBC report, Čolić's deputy made the statement, &quot;I have come here to confirm Charles Darwin is still alive&quot; and announced that the decision was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3642460.stm Serbia reverses Darwin suspension]&lt;/ref&gt; Čolić resigned after the government said that she had caused &quot;problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3663196.stm 'Anti-Darwin' Serb minister quits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], a mostly [[Islam]]ic country, evolution is often a controversial subject. Evolution was added to the school curriculum shortly after the Turkish Revolution of the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name=Edis&gt;{{cite web

One anti-evolutionist group in Turkey is the [[Istanbul]] based Bilim Arastirma Vakfi (BAV), or &quot;Science Research Foundation&quot;, which was founded by [[Adnan Oktar]].

The situation is very fragile, and the status of evolution in education varies from one government to the next. For example, in 1985 Education Minister Vehbi Dincerier had scientific creationism added to high school texts, and also had the discredited [[Lamarckism]] presented alongside Darwinism.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Only in 1998 was this changed somewhat, with texts presenting a more balanced view, though still mentioning creationism and Lamarckism.&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt; At present the moderate Islamist [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], which is sympathetic to creationist views,&lt;ref name=Edis /&gt; holds power. It was elected in 2002 and again with a greater majority in 2007.

In general, material that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey. For example, in November 2007 a prosecutor launched a probe into whether biologist Richard Dawkins' book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' is &quot;an attack on religious values&quot;. Its publisher could face trial and up to one year in prison if the prosecutor concludes that the book &quot;incites religious hatred&quot; and insults religious values.&lt;ref name='CNN 2007-11-28'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Turkey probes atheist's 'God' book | date= 2007-11-28 | publisher=AP, CNN | url =http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,1917,-Turkey-probes-atheists-God-book,CNN,page3#92514 | work =reposted at RichardDawkins.net | pages = | accessdate = 2009-02-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, a schoolgirl in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] and her father decided to take the teaching of evolution in Russian schools to court. The position of the [[Russian Ministry of Education]] supports the theory of evolution.

'''Human evolution''', or '''''anthropogenesis''''', is the part of biological [[evolution]] concerning the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a distinct [[species]] from other [[hominan]]s, [[great apes]] and placental [[mammals]]. It is the subject of a broad [[science|scientific inquiry]] that seeks to understand and describe how this change occurred. The study of human evolution encompasses many scientific disciplines, most notably [[physical anthropology]], [[primatology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]] and [[genetics]].

The term &quot;human&quot;, in the context of human evolution, refers to the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', but studies of human evolution usually include other [[hominin]]s, such as the [[australopithecines]]. The ''Homo'' genus diverged from the australopithecines about 2 Ma in Africa. Scientists have estimated that humans branched off from their common ancestor with [[chimpanzee]]s—the only other living hominins—about 5&amp;ndash;7 Ma. Several typological species of ''Homo'', now [[Species#Extinct organisms|extinct]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Collard, Bernard Wood; ''How reliable are human phylogenetic hypotheses?'' quote: ''.. existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable'' http://www.pnas.org/content/97/9/5003.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; evolved. These include ''[[Homo erectus]]'', which [[habitat|inhabited]] Asia, and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', which inhabited Europe.

[[Archaic Homo sapiens|Archaic ''Homo sapiens'']] evolved between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago. The dominant view among scientists is the [[recent African origin of modern humans]] (RAO) that ''H. sapiens'' evolved in Africa and spread across the globe, replacing populations of ''H. erectus'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''. Scientists supporting the alternative hypothesis on the [[multiregional origin of modern humans]] (MTO) view modern humans as having evolved as a single, widespread population from existing ''Homo'' species, particularly ''H. erectus''. The fossil evidence is insufficient to resolve this vigorous debate,&lt;ref name=RLeakey&gt;{{cite book|last=Leakey|first=Richard|title=The Origin of Humankind|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|year=1994|series=Science Masters Series|pages=87–89|isbn=0465053130}}&lt;/ref&gt; while studies of [[Human genetic variation|human population genetics]] have largely supported a recent African Origin explanation.

==Introduction==
The word ''homo'', the name of the biological genus to which humans belong is [[Latin]] for &quot;human&quot;. It was chosen originally by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his classification system. The word &quot;human&quot; is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. (Latin for &quot;man&quot; in the gender-specific sense is ''vir'', as in &quot;[[Wiktionary:virile|''vir''ile]]&quot;.) The Latin &quot;homo&quot; derives from the Indo-European root, &quot;dhghem,&quot; earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=dhghem|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=4th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2000|url=http://www.bartelby.org/61/roots/IE104.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carolus Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the [[great ape]]s to be the closest biological relatives of human beings due to [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[anatomical]] similarities. The possibility of biologically linking humans with earlier apes by descent only became clear after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. This argued for the idea of the biological evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book, however, did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that &quot;Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;.

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]].

A major problem was the lack of fossil intermediaries. It was only in the 1920s that such [[fossil]]s were discovered in Africa. In 1925, [[Raymond Dart]] described [[Australopithecus africanus]]. The [[type specimen]] was the [[Taung Child]], an australopithecine infant discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an [[endocranial cast]] of the individual's brain. Although the brain was small (410&amp;nbsp;cm³), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], and the position of the [[foramen magnum]] was evidence of [[bipedal]] locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

The '''australopithecines''' are now thought to be ancestors of the genus ''Homo'', the group to which modern humans belong. Both australopithecines and ''Homo sapiens'' are part of the tribe [[Hominini]]. Recent data suggests '''australopithecines''' were a diverse group and that ''A. africanus'' may not be a direct ancestor of modern humans. Reclassification of australopithecines that originally were split into either [[gracile]] or [[robust]] varities has put the latter into a family of its own ''[[Paranthropus]]''. Taxonomists today place human beings as well as '''australopithecines''' and related species in the same family as other great apes, in the Hominidae.

==Before ''Homo''==
The evolutionary history of the [[primate]]s can be traced back for some 85 million years, as one of the oldest of all surviving placental mammal groups. The oldest known primates come from North America, but they were widespread in Eurasia and Africa as well, during the tropical conditions of the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]].

With the beginning of modern climates, marked by the formation of the first Antarctic ice in the early [[Oligocene]] around 30 Ma, primates went extinct everywhere but Africa and southern Asia. One such primate from this time was ''[[Notharctus]]''. Fossil evidence found in Germany in the 1980s was determined to be about 16.5 million years old, some 1.5 million years older than similar species from East Africa. It suggests that the primate lineage of the great apes first appeared in Eurasia and not Africa.

The discoveries suggest that the early ancestors of the hominids (the family of great apes and humans) migrated to Eurasia from Africa about 17 Ma, just before these two continents were cut off from each other by an expansion of the Mediterranean Sea. Begun&lt;ref name = &quot;Kordos-p17&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordos L, Begun DR |title=Primates from Rudabánya: allocation of specimens to individuals, sex and age categories |journal=J. Hum. Evol. |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=17–39 |year=2001 |pmid=11139358 |doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0437}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that these primates flourished in Eurasia and that their lineage leading to the African apes and humans—[[Dryopithecus]]—migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa.  The surviving tropical population, which is seen most completely in the upper Eocene and lowermost Oligocene fossil beds of the [[Fayum]] depression southwest of Cairo, gave rise to all living primates—[[lemur]]s of Madagascar, [[loris]]es of Southeast Asia, [[galago]]s or &quot;bush babies&quot; of Africa, and the [[anthropoid]]s; [[platyrrhine]]s or New World monkeys, and [[catarrhine]]s or Old World monkeys and the great apes and humans.

The earliest known catarrhine is ''[[Kamoyapithecus]]'' from uppermost Oligocene at Eragaleit in the northern Kenya rift valley, dated to 24 [[annum|Ma]] (million years ago). Its ancestry is generally thought to be close to such genera as ''[[Aegyptopithecus]]'', ''[[Propliopithecus]]'', and ''[[Parapithecus]]'' from the Fayum, at around 35 Ma. There are no fossils from the intervening 11 million years. No near ancestor to South American platyrrhines, whose fossil record begins at around 30 Ma, can be identified among the North African fossil species, and possibly lies in other forms that lived in West Africa that were caught up in the still-mysterious transatlantic sweepstakes that sent primates, rodents, boa constrictors, and cichlid fishes from Africa to South America sometime in the Oligocene.

In the early [[Miocene]], after 22 Ma, many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Because the fossils at 20 Ma include fragments attributed to ''[[Victoriapithecus]]'', the earliest cercopithecoid; the other forms are (by default) grouped as hominoids, without clear evidence as to which are closest to living apes and humans. Among the presently recognized genera in this group, which ranges up to 13 Ma, we find ''[[Proconsul (genus)|Proconsul]]'', ''[[Rangwapithecus]]'', ''[[Dendropithecus]]'', ''[[Limnopithecus]]'', ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'', ''[[Equatorius]]'',  ''[[Nyanzapithecus]]'', ''[[Afropithecus]]'', ''[[Heliopithecus]]'', and ''[[Kenyapithecus]]'', all from East Africa. The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of middle Miocene age from sites far distant—''[[Otavipithecus]]'' from cave deposits in Namibia, and ''[[Pierolapithecus]]'' and ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' from France, Spain and Austria—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the early and middle Miocene.

The youngest of the Miocene hominoids, ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', is from 9 Ma coal beds in Italy.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of [[gibbon]]s (family [[Hylobatidae]]) became distinct between 18 and 12 Ma, and that of [[orangutan]]s (subfamily Ponginae) at about 12 Ma; we have no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so far unknown South East Asian hominid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Ramapithecus]]'' from India and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma.

It has been suggested that species close to last common ancestors of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by ''[[Nakalipithecus]]'' fossils found in Kenya and ''[[Ouranopithecus]]'' found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the [[gorilla]]s, and then the chimpanzee (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans; human DNA (when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms) is approximately 98.4 percent identical to the DNA of chimpanzees (see [[Human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record of gorillas and chimpanzees is quite limited. Both poor preservation (rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone) and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem.

Other Hominines, however, likely adapted (along with antelopes, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, and horses) to the somewhat drier environments outside the equatorial belt (which contracted after about 8 Ma; reference needed) and their fossils are relatively well known. The earliest are ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' (7 Ma) and ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' (6 Ma), followed by:
*''[[Ardipithecus]]'' (5.5&amp;ndash;4.4 Ma), with species ''[[Ardipithecus kadabba|Ar. kadabba]]'' and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus|Ar. ramidus]]'';
*''[[Australopithecus]]'' (4&amp;ndash;2 Ma), with species ''[[Australopithecus anamensis|Au. anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali|Au. bahrelghazali]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus garhi|Au. garhi]]''; 
*''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (3&amp;ndash;2.7 Ma), with species ''[[Kenyanthropus platyops]]''
*''[[Paranthropus]]'' (3&amp;ndash;1.2 Ma), with species ''[[Paranthropus aethiopicus|P. aethiopicus]]'', ''[[Paranthropus boisei|P. boisei]]'', and ''[[Paranthropus robustus|P. robustus]]'';
*''Homo'' (2 Ma&amp;ndash;present), with species ''Homo habilis'', ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'', ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', ''[[Homo georgicus]]'', ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', ''[[Homo cepranensis]]'', ''Homo erectus'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'', ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'', ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'', ''Archaic Homo sapiens'', ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''

==Genus ''Homo''==
In modern taxonomy, ''Homo sapiens'' is the only [[extant taxon|non-extinct]] species of its genus, ''Homo''.  Likewise, the ongoing study of the origins of ''Homo sapiens'' often demonstrates that there were other ''Homo'' species, all of which are now extinct.  While some of these other species might have been ancestors of ''H. sapiens'', many were likely our &quot;cousins&quot;, having speciated away from our ancestral line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strait DS, Grine FE, Moniz MA |title=A reappraisal of early hominid phylogeny |journal=J. Hum. Evol. |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=17–82 |year=1997 |pmid=9034954 |doi=10.1006/jhev.1996.0097}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is not yet a consensus as to which of these groups should count as separate species and which as subspecies of another species.  In some cases this is due to the paucity of fossils, in other cases it is due to the slight differences used to classify species in the ''Homo'' genus. The [[Sahara Pump Theory|Sahara pump theory]] provides an explanation of the early variation in the genus ''Homo''.

Based on [[archaeological]] and [[paleontological]] evidence, it has been possible to infer the ancient dietary practices of various ''Homo'' species and to study the role of diet in human (''Homo'') physical and behavioral evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0195183460&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution of the Human Diet: The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable |author=Ungar, Peter S. |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=US |year=2006 |isbn=0195183460 |page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0897897366&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Ungar, Peter S. &amp; Teaford, Mark F. |title=Human Diet: Its Origin and Evolution |publisher=Bergin &amp; Garvey |location=Westport, CT |year=2002 |isbn=0897897366 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0897895169-Bogin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bogin |first=Barry |editor=Romanucci-Ross, Lola; Moerman, Daniel E.; &amp; Tancredi, Laurence R. |title=The Anthropology of Medicine: From Culture to Method |edition=3 |year=1997 |publisher=Bergen and Garvey |location=South Hadley, Mass. |isbn=0897895169 |pages=96–142 |chapter=The evolution of human nutrition |chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031203003838/http://citd.scar.utoronto.ca/ANTAO1/Projects/Bogin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnicot NA |title=Human nutrition: evolutionary perspectives |journal=Integr Physiol Behav Sci |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=114–17 |year=2005, April/June |pmid=17393680 |url= |doi=10.1007/BF02734246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonard WR, Snodgrass JJ, Robertson ML |title=Effects of brain evolution on human nutrition and metabolism |journal=Annu Rev Nutr. |volume=27 |pages=311–27 |year=2007 |pmid=17439362 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.27.061406.093659 |url=http://www.pinniped.net/LeonardARN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-29}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Homo habilis''===
''[[H. habilis]]'' lived from about 2.4 to 1.4 [[annum|Ma]]. ''H. habilis'', the first species of the genus ''Homo'', evolved in South and East Africa in the late [[Pliocene]] or early [[Pleistocene]], 2.5&amp;ndash;2 Ma, when it diverged from the Australopithecines. ''H. habilis'' had smaller molars and larger brains than the Australopithecines, and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones.  One of the first known hominids, it was nicknamed 'handy man' by its discoverer, [[Louis Leakey]] due to its association with [[stone tools]] (mode 1). Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of ''Homo'' and into ''Australopithecus'' due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to [[arboreal|living on trees]] rather than to [[bipedalism|moving on two legs]] like ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt; Wood, B. &amp; Collard, M. (1999) The changing face of Genus Homo. Evol. Anth. 8(6) 195-207&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Homo rudolfensis'' and ''Homo georgicus''===
These are proposed species names for fossils from about 1.9&amp;ndash;1.6 Ma, the relation of which with ''H. habilis'' is not yet clear.
*[[Homo rudolfensis|''H. rudolfensis'']] refers to a single, incomplete skull from Kenya.

===''Homo ergaster'' and ''Homo erectus''===
[[Image:Humanevolutionchart.png|One current view of the temporal and geographical distribution of hominid populations. Other interpretations differ mainly in the taxonomy and geographical distribution of hominid species.|thumb|300px]]

The first fossils of ''Homo erectus'' were discovered by Dutch physician [[Eugene Dubois]] in 
1891 on the [[Indonesia]]n island of Java. He originally gave the material the name ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' based on its morphology that he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turner W |title=On M. Dubois' Description of Remains recently found in Java, named by him Pithecanthropus erectus: With Remarks on so-called Transitional Forms between Apes and Man |journal=Journal of anatomy and physiology |volume=29 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=424–45 |year=1895 |pmid=17232143 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo erectus|H. erectus]]'' lived from about 1.8 Ma to 70,000 years ago. Often the early phase, from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered to be a separate species, ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'', or it is seen as a subspecies of ''H. erectus'', ''[[Homo erectus|Homo erectus ergaster]]''.

In the Early Pleistocene, 1.5&amp;ndash;1 Ma, in Africa, Asia, and Europe, presumably, some populations of  ''Homo habilis'' evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, ''H. erectus''. In addition ''H. erectus'' was the first human ancestor to walk truly upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spoor F, Wood B, Zonneveld F |title=Implications of early hominid labyrinthine morphology for evolution of human bipedal locomotion |journal=Nature |volume=369 |issue=6482 |pages=645–8 |year=1994 |pmid=8208290 |doi=10.1038/369645a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the [[foramen magnum]] (the hole in the skull where the spine enters). They may have used fire to cook their meat.

{{seealso|Control of fire by early humans}}

A famous example of ''Homo erectus'' is [[Peking Man]]; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists are now using the term ''Homo ergaster'' for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserving ''H. erectus'' only for those fossils found in the Asian region and meeting certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from ''H. ergaster''. However, this article does not follow that usage.

===''Homo cepranensis'' and ''Homo antecessor''===
These are proposed as species that may be intermediate between ''H. erectus'' and ''H. heidelbergensis''.

===''Homo sapiens''===
{{main|Early Homo sapiens}}
''H. sapiens'' (&quot;sapiens&quot; means wise or intelligent) has lived from about 250,000 years ago to the present. Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the Middle [[Pleistocene]], around 250,000 years ago, the trend in [[Cranial capacity|skull expansion]] and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed, providing evidence for a transition from ''H. erectus'' to ''H. sapiens''. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of ''H. erectus'' out of Africa, then a further [[speciation]] of ''H. sapiens'' from ''H. erectus'' in Africa (there is little evidence that this speciation occurred elsewhere). Then a subsequent migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier dispersed ''H. erectus''.  This migration and origin theory is usually referred to as the [[single-origin theory]]. However, the current evidence does not ''preclude'' multiregional speciation, either. This is a hotly debated area in [[paleoanthropology]].

Current research has established that human beings are genetically highly homogenous; that is, the DNA of individuals is more alike than usual for most species, which may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrose1998&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Distinctive genetic characteristics have arisen, however, primarily as the result of small groups of people moving into new environmental circumstances. These adapted traits are a very small component of the ''Homo sapiens'' genome, but include various characteristics such as skin color and nose form, in addition to internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently in high altitudes.

===''Homo floresiensis''===
{{main|Homo floresiensis}}
''H. floresiensis'', which lived from approximately 100,000 to 12,000 before present, has been nicknamed ''[[hobbit]]'' for its small size, possibly a result of [[insular dwarfism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown P, Sutikna T, Morwood MJ, ''et al.'' |title=A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia |journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7012 |pages=1055–61 |year=2004 |pmid=15514638 |doi=10.1038/nature02999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. floresiensis'' is intriguing both for its size and its age, being a concrete example of a recent species of the genus ''Homo'' that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words, ''H. floresiensis'' share a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path. The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in 2003 it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old. The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the ''H. sapiens'' average of 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

However, there is an ongoing debate over whether ''H. floresiensis'' is indeed a separate species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Argue D, Donlon D, Groves C, Wright R |title=Homo floresiensis: microcephalic, pygmoid, Australopithecus, or Homo? |journal=J.

This coupled with pathological dwarfism could indeed create a hobbit-like human. The other major attack on ''H. floresiensis'' is that it was found with tools only associated with ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

==Use of tools==
Using tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution—most notably the continued expansion of the human brain.  Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes about 20 [[watt]]s (400 kilocalories per day), which is one fifth of the energy consumption of a human body. Increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more energy-rich plant products. Researchers have suggested that early hominids were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibbons, Ann |title=Solving the Brain's Energy Crisis |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5368 |pages=1345–47 |year=1998 |pmid=9634409 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5368.1345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts. There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated.
 
It should be noted that many species make and use tools, but it is the human species that dominates the areas of making and using more complex tools. A good question is, what species made and used the first tools?  The oldest known tools are the &quot;Oldowan stone tools&quot; from Ethiopia. It was discovered that these tools are from 2.5 to 2.6 million years old, which predates the earliest known &quot;Homo&quot; species. There is no known evidence that any &quot;Homo&quot; specimens appeared by 2.5 Ma. A Homo fossil was found near some Oldowan tools, and its age was noted at 2.3 million years old, suggesting that maybe the Homo species did indeed create and use these tools. It is surely possible, but not solid evidence. Bernard Wood noted that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; coexisted with the early Homo species in the area of the &quot;Oldowan Industrial Complex&quot; over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence that points to Paranthropus as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early &quot;Homo&quot; species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, Homo was always present, but Paranthropus was not.&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron. ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.).,  Pearson Education, Inc.  (2007). ISBN 0-13-227584-8  pages 786-788&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the Homo and Paranthropus species were toolmakers. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles that chimps lack. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, making the human hand more successful at precision grasping than the chimpanzee hand.  Susman defended that modern anatomy of the human thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed toolmakers.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;

===Stone tools===
Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 Ma, when ''H. habilis'' in Eastern Africa used so-called [[pebble tools]], [[Chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] made out of round pebbles that had been split by  simple strikes.&lt;ref name=Plummer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plummer T |title=Flaked stones and old bones: Biological and cultural evolution at the dawn of technology |journal=Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. |volume=Suppl 39 |issue= |pages=118–64 |year=2004 |pmid=15605391 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]], or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (Early Stone Age, ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago), the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (Middle Stone Age, until 50,000–30,000 years ago), and the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The period from 700,000–300,000 years ago is also known as the [[Acheulean]], when ''H. ergaster'' (or ''erectus'') made large stone [[hand-axe]]s out of [[flint]] and [[quartzite]], at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later &quot;[[retouch]]ed&quot; by additional, more subtle strikes at the sides of the [[lithic flake|flake]]s. After 350,000 BP ([[Before Present]]) the more refined so-called [[Levallois technique]] was developed. It consisted of a series of consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers (&quot;racloirs&quot;), needles, and flattened needles were made.&lt;ref name=Plummer/&gt; Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the immigrant [[Cro-Magnon]]s (knives, blades, skimmers). In this period they also started to make tools out of bone.

===Modern humans and the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; debate===
{{see also|Modern human behavior}}
Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (''habilis'', ''ergaster'', ''neanderthal'') started at a higher level than the previous one; but once that phase started, further development was slow. In other words, these particular ''Homo'' species were culturally conservative. After 50,000 BP, however, human culture apparently started to change at a much greater speed.  [[Jared Diamond]], author of ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'', and other anthropologists characterize this as a &quot;[[Behavioral modernity|Great Leap Forward]].&quot;  Modern humans started burying their dead carefully, making clothing out of hides, developing sophisticated hunting techniques (such as using [[trapping pit]]s or driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in [[cave painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ambrose SH |title=Paleolithic technology and human evolution |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5509 |pages=1748–53 |year=2001 |pmid=11249821 |doi=10.1126/science.1059487}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speed-up of cultural change seems connected with the arrival of behaviorally modern humans, ''Homo sapiens''. As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, ''neanderthalensis'' populations are found with technology similar to other contemporary ''neanderthalensis'' populations.

Theoretically, modern human behavior is taken to include four ingredient capabilities: [[abstract thinking]] (concepts free from specific examples), [[planning]] (taking steps to achieve a further goal), [[innovation]] (finding new solutions), and [[symbolic behaviour]] (such as images and rituals). Among concrete examples of modern human behaviour, anthropologists include specialization of tools, use of jewelry and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and [[barter]] trade networks. Nevertheless, debate continues as to whether a &quot;revolution&quot; led to modern humans (&quot;the big bang of human consciousness&quot;), or whether the evolution was more gradual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mcbrearty S, Brooks AS |title=The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior |journal=J. Hum. Evol. |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=453–563 |year=2000 |pmid=11102266 |doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of human evolution==
Today, all humans are classified as belonging to the species ''Homo sapiens sapiens.'' However, this is not the first species of hominids: the first species of genus ''Homo'', ''Homo habilis'', evolved in East Africa at least 2 Ma, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. ''Homo erectus'' evolved more than 1.8 Ma, and by 1.5 Ma had spread throughout the Old World. Virtually all physical anthropologists agree that ''Homo sapiens'' evolved out of ''Homo erectus.'' Anthropologists have been divided as to whether ''Homo sapiens'' evolved as one interconnected species from ''H. erectus'' (called the Multiregional Model, or the Regional Continuity Model), or evolved only in East Africa, and then migrated out of Africa and replaced ''H. erectus'' populations throughout the Old World (called the Out of Africa Model or the Complete Replacement Model). Anthropologists continue to debate both possibilities, but most anthropologists currently favor the Out of Africa model.

===Multiregional model===
{{main|Multiregional hypothesis}}
Advocates of the Multiregional model, primarily [[Milford Wolpoff]] and his associates, have argued that the simultaneous evolution of ''H. sapiens'' in different parts of Europe and Asia would have been possible if there was a degree of [[gene flow]] between archaic populations.&lt;ref&gt;Thorne, Alan, and Milford Wolpoff (1992) &quot;The Multiregional Evolution of humans&quot; in ''Scientific American, April 76-93; Smith, Fred and Frank Spencer, eds (1984) ''The Origin of Modern Humans''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities of morphological features between archaic European and Chinese populations and modern ''H. sapiens'' from the same regions, Wolpoff argues, support a regional continuity only possible within the Multiregional model.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Lavenda and Emily A. Shultz ''Anthropology, what does it mean to be human?'' Oxford (New York:2008) 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolpoff and others further argue that this model is consistent with [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal patterns]] of phenotypic variation (Wolpoff 1993).

===Out of Africa model===
{{seealso|Recent single origin hypothesis}}

According to the Out of Africa Model, developed by [[Chris Stringer]] and Peter Andrews, modern ''H. sapiens'' evolved in Africa 200,000 years ago. Homo sapiens began migrating from Africa between 70,000 – 50,000 years ago and would eventually replace existing hominid species in Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070718-african-origin.html Modern Humans Came Out of Africa, &quot;Definitive&quot; Study Says]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stringer and Peter Andrews  (1988) &quot;Genetic and Fossil Evidence for the Origin of Modern Humans&quot; in ''Science'' 239: 1263-1268&lt;/ref&gt; The Out of Africa Model has gained support by recent research using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, they concluded that all were descended from a woman from Africa, dubbed [[Mitochondrial Eve]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;&gt;Rebecca L. Cann, Mark Stoneking, Allan C. Wilson (1987) ''[http://artsci.wustl.edu/~landc/html/cann/ Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution]'' in ''Nature'' '''325''': 31-36 {{PMID|3025745}} &lt;/ref&gt;

There are differing theories on whether there was a single exodus, or several (a Multiple Dispersal Model). A Multiple Dispersal Model involves the Southern Dispersal theory,&lt;ref name=&quot;lahr&quot;&gt;[http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm Searching for traces of the Southern Dispersal], by Dr. Marta Mirazón Lahr, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the Horn of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the Levant. A second wave of humans dispersed across the Sinai peninsula into Asia, resulting in the bulk of human population for Eurasia. This second group possessed a more sophisticated tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of the Holocene era.&lt;ref name=&quot;lahr&quot;/&gt; The multiple dispersals models is contradicted by studies  indicating that the populations of Eurasia and the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania are all descended from the same mitochondrial DNA lineages. The study further indicates that there was most likely only one single migration out of Africa that gave rise to all Non-African populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of the two models===
The two models differ widely. [[Richard Leakey]] summarizes the most obvious differences as follows: 
{{cquote|The multiregional evolution model describes an evolutionary trend throughout the Old World toward modern ''Homo sapiens'', with little population migration and no population replacement, whereas the 'Out of Africa' model calls for the evolution of ''Homo sapiens'' in one location only, followed by extensive population migration across the Old World, resulting in the replacement of existing premodern populations.&lt;ref name=RLeakey/&gt;}}

The Multiregional model suggests that the fossil record should show the same regional differences in anatomical characteristics that are currently visible today. Racial differences would be deep-rooted, going back as much as two million years.  In the Out of Africa model, however, the fossil record would not be expected to show continuity of anatomical characteristics over time; on the contrary, the regional characteristics of older fossils would likely be replaced globally by more modern African ones. Racial differences would be shallow-rooted, having evolved over a relatively short period of time.&lt;ref name=RLeakey/&gt;

=== Implications for the concept of race ===
In a 1995 article, [[Leonard Lieberman]] and [[Fatimah Jackson]] point out that the concepts of cline, population, and ethnicity, as well as humanitarian and political concerns, have led many scientists away from the notion of race; nevertheless, a recent survey showed that physical anthropologists were evenly divided as to whether race is a valid biological concept. They note that among physical anthropologists the vast majority of opposition to the race concept comes from population geneticists, so any new support for a biological concept of race would likely come from another source, namely, the study of human evolution. They therefore ask what, if any, implications the current models of human evolution may have for any biological conception of race.&lt;ref name=&quot;lieberman&quot;&gt;Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda C. Jackson (1995) &quot;Race and Three Models of Human Origin&quot; in ''­American Anthropologist'' Vol. 97, No. 2, pp. 232-239&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The major implication for race in the multiregional evolution continuity model involves the time depth of a million or more years in which race differentiation might evolve in diverse ecological regions [...]. This must be balanced against the degree of gene flow and the transregional operation of natural selection on encephalization due to development of tools and, more broadly, culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;lieberman&quot;/&gt;}}

{{Unicode|}}Lieberman and Jackson identified these implications of the Out of Africa model on the race concept:

{{cquote|The shallow time dimension minimizes the degree to which racial differences could have evolved [...]. [T]he mitochondrial DNA model presents a view ... minimizing race differences and avoiding racist implications. However, the model, as interpreted by Wainscoat et al. (1989:34), does describe &quot;a major division of human populations into an African and a Eurasian group.&quot; This conclusion could best be used to emphasize the degree of biological differences, and thereby provide support for the race concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;lieberman&quot;/&gt;}}

Lieberman and Jackson argued that while advocates of both the Multiregional model and the Out of Africa model use the word race and make racial assumptions, none define the term. They conclude, &quot;Each model has implications that both magnify and minimize the differences between races. Yet each model seems to take race and races as a conceptual reality. The net result is that those anthropologists who prefer to view races as a reality are encouraged to do so.&quot; However, Lieberman and Jackson conclude that students of human evolution would be better off avoiding the word race, instead describing genetic differences in terms of populations and clinal gradations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lieberman&quot;/&gt;

===Moving to the savanna and the aquatic ape hypothesis===
{{main|Aquatic ape hypothesis}}
The majority of scientists believe in a model, first propounded by [[Raymond Dart]], that the arboreal existence of early human was replaced by a move to the savannah for hunting animals, even though major adaptations occurred in human ancestors long before the savannahs existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richard Leakey | first = Roger Lewin | authorlink = Richard Leakey | title = Origins Reconsidered| year = 1992 | publisher = Little, Brown &amp; Co | isbn = 0 349 10345 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative model of human evolution, strongly disputed by many researchers, is the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]] (AAH). This asserts that wading, swimming and diving for food exerted a strong evolutionary effect on the ancestors of the genus ''Homo'' and is in part responsible for the split between the [[Common descent|common ancestors]] of humans and other great apes.

==Genetics ==
Molecular biologists starting with [[Allan Wilson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;/&gt; on [[mtDNA]] have produced observations relevant to human evolution.

===Age of the common ancestor===
By estimating the rate at which mutations occur in mtDNA, the age of the common ancestral mtDNA type can be estimated: &quot;the common ancestral mtDNA (type a) links mtDNA types that have diverged by an average of nearly 0.57%. Assuming a rate of 2%-4% per million years, this implies that the common ancestor of all surviving mtDNA types existed 140,000-290,000 years ago.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;/&gt; This observation is robust, and this common direct female line ancestor (or mitochondrial [[most recent common ancestor]] (mtMRCA)) of all extant humans has become known as [[mitochondrial eve]]. The observation that the mtMRCA is the direct matrilineal ancestor of all living humans does not mean either that she was the first anatomically modern human, nor that no other female humans lived concurrently with her. This is because other women might have lived at the same time and passed their genes down to living humans, but that their mitochondrial lineages was lost over time. This could be due to random events such as producing only male children. 

===African origin for modern humans===
There is evidence that modern human mtDNA has an African origin: &quot;We infer from the tree of minimum length... that Africa is a likely source of the human mitochondrial gene pool. This inference comes from the observation that one of the two primary branches leads exclusively to African mtDNAs... while the second primary branch also leads to African mtDNAs... By postulating that the common ancestral mtDNA... was African, we minimize the number of intercontinental migrations needed to account for the geographic distribution of mtDNA types.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;/&gt;

The broad study of African genetic diversity headed by Sarah Tishkoff found the [[Bushmen|San people]] to express the greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct populations sampled, making them one of 14 &quot;ancestral population clusters&quot;.The research also located the origin of modern human migration in south-western Africa, near the coastal border of [[Namibia]] and [[Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8027269.stm BBC World News &quot;Africa's genetic secrets unlocked&quot;], 1 May 2009; the results were published in the online edition of the journal ''Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lineage descent===
MtDNA types (haplogroups) do not cluster by geography, ethnicity or race, implying multiple female lineages were involved in founding modern human populations. Many closely related lineages spread geographically and many populations contain distantly related lineages.  &quot;The second implication of the tree (Fig. 3)—that each non-African population has multiple origins—can be illustrated most simply with the New Guineans. Take, as an example, mtDNA type 49, a lineage whose nearest relative is not in New Guinea, but in Asia (type 50). Asian lineage 50 is closer genealogically to this New Guinea lineage than to other Asian mtDNA lineages. Six other lineages lead exclusively to New Guinean mtDNAs, each originating at a different place in the tree (types 12, 13, 26-29, 65, 95 and 127-134 in Fig. 3). This small region of New Guinea (mainly the Eastern Highlands Province) thus seems to have been colonised by at least seven maternal lineages (Tables 2 and 3). In the same way, we calculate the minimum numbers of female lineages that colonised Australia, Asia and Europe (Tables 2 and 3). Each estimate is based on the number of region-specific clusters in the tree (Fig. 3, Tables 2 and 3). These numbers, ranging from 15 to 36 (Tables 2 and 3), will probably rise as more types of human mtDNA are discovered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;/&gt;

===Y chromosome findings===
The [[Y chromosome]] is much larger than mtDNA, and is relatively homogeneous; therefore it has taken much longer to find distinct lineages and to analyse them. Conversely, because the Y chromosome is so large by comparison, it holds more genetic information. Y chromosome studies show similar findings  made with mtDNA. The estimate for the age of the ancestral Y chromosome for all extant Y chromosomes is given at about 70,000 years ago and is also placed in Africa, this individual is sometimes referred to as [[Y chromosome Adam]]. The difference in dates between Y chromosome Adam and mitochondrial Eve is usually attributed to a higher extinction rate for Y chromosomes due to greater differential reproductive success between individual men, which means that a small number of very successful men may produce a great many children, while a larger number of less successful men will produce far less children. Keita ''et al.'' (2004) say, with reference to Y chromosome and mtDNA and concepts of race: {{quotation|Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA genealogies are especially interesting because they demonstrate the lack of concordance of lineages with morphology and facilitate a phylogenetic analysis. Individuals with the same morphology do not necessarily cluster with each other by lineage, and a given lineage does not include only individuals with the same trait complex (or 'racial type'). Y-chromosome DNA from Africa alone suffices to make this point. Africa contains populations whose members have a range of external phenotypes. This variation has usually been described in terms of 'race' (Caucasoids, Pygmoids, Congoids, Khoisanoids). But the Y-chromosome clade defined by the PN2 transition (PN2/M35, PN2/M2) [see [[Haplogroup E3b (Y-DNA)|haplogroup E3b]] and [[Haplogroup E3a (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup E3a]]] shatters the boundaries of phenotypically defined races and true breeding populations across a great geographical expanse. African peoples with a range of skin colors, hair forms and physiognomies have substantial percentages of males whose Y chromosomes form closely related clades with each other, but not with others who are phenotypically similar. The individuals in the morphologically or geographically defined 'races' are not characterized by 'private' distinct lineages restricted to each of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1455.html Conceptualizing human variation]'' (2004) by S O Y Keita, R A Kittles1, C D M Royal, G E Bonney, P Furbert-Harris, G M Dunston &amp; C N Rotimi in Nature Genetics  '''36''', S17 - S20 {{PMID|15507998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Human accelerated regions===
[[Human accelerated regions]] are areas of the genome that differ between Humans and Chimpanzees to a greater extent than can be explained by genetic drift over the time since the two species shared a common ancestor.  Thus these regions show signs of being subject to natural selection leading to the evolution of distinctly human traits.  Two notable such regions are [[HAR1F]] which is believed to be related to brain development and HAR2 (a.k.a [[HACNS1]]) that may have played a role in the development of the [[Thumb|opposable thumb]].

==Additional notes==
*The validity of evolution and the origins of humanity have often been a subject of great [[political]] and [[religious]] controversy within the non-scientific community (see ''[[Creation-evolution controversy]]'' and ''[[Hybrid-origin]]'').
*The classification of humans and their relatives has changed considerably over time (see ''[[Ape#History of hominoid taxonomy|History of hominoid taxonomy]]'').
*Speculation about the future evolution of humans is often explored in [[science fiction]] as continued speciation of humans as they fill various [[ecological niche]]s (see ''[[Adaptive radiation]]'' and ''[[Co-evolution]]''), as well as deliberate self-modification (see ''[[Participant evolution]]'').

&quot;'''Scopes Trial'''&quot; (''State v. Scopes,'' ''Scopes v. State, 152 Tenn. 424, 278 S.W. 57 (Tenn. 1926)'', often called the &quot;'''Scopes Monkey Trial'''&quot;) was an [[United States|American]] [[legal case]] that tested the [[Butler Act]], which made it unlawful, in any state-funded educational establishment in [[Tennessee]], &quot;''to teach any theory that denies the story of the [[Creation according to Genesis|Divine Creation]] of man as taught in the [[Bible]], and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/tennstat.htm Full text of the Butler Act and the bill that repealed it]&lt;/ref&gt; This is often interpreted as meaning that the law forbade the teaching of any aspect of the theory of [[evolution]]. The case was a critical turning point in the United States' [[history of the creation-evolution controversy|creation-evolution controversy]].

After the passage of the Butler Act, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] financed a test case, where a [[Dayton, Tennessee]] high school teacher named [[John Scopes]] intentionally violated the Act. Scopes was charged on May 5, 1925 with teaching evolution from a chapter in a textbook which showed ideas developed from those set out in [[Charles Darwin's]] book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. The trial pitted two of the pre-eminent legal minds of the time against one another; three-time presidential candidate, Congressman and former Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]] headed up the prosecution and prominent trial attorney [[Clarence Darrow]] spoke for the defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;university44&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakim | first = Joy | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = War, Peace, and All That Jazz | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1995 | location = New York, New York | pages = 44–45 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-19-509514-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous trial was made infamous by the fictionalized accounts given in the 1955 play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', the [[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]], and the [[Inherit the Wind (1965 film)|1965]], [[Inherit the Wind (1988 film)|1988]], and [[Inherit the Wind (1999 film)|1999]] television films of the same title.

==Background==
[[Image:John t scopes.jpg|thumb|right|John Scopes in 1925]]
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) offered to defend anyone accused of teaching the theory of evolution in defiance of the [[Butler Act]]. [[George Rappleyea]], who managed several local mines, convinced a group of businessmen in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], (a town of 1,756), that the controversy of such a trial would give Dayton much needed publicity. With their agreement, he called in his friend, 24-year-old [[John T. Scopes]], who was Clark County High School's football coach and had substituted for Principal Ferguson in a science class. Rappleyea asked Scopes to teach the theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linder Introduction&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/evolut.htm An introduction to the John Scopes (Monkey) Trial] by Douglas Linder. UMKC Law. Retrieved April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappleyea pointed out that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use a textbook—George Hunter's ''[[Civic Biology]]'' (1914)—which explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, and that teachers were therefore effectively required to break the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linder Introduction&quot; /&gt; Scopes mentioned that while he couldn't remember if he actually taught evolution in class, he did however go through the evolution chart and chapter with the class. Scopes added to the group &quot;If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; Presley, James and John T.Scopes. ''Center of the Storm'' p.60. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.(1967)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scopes became an increasingly willing participant, even incriminating himself and urging students to testify against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1997|p=108}}  &quot;Scopes had urged the students to testify against him, and coached them in their answers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  He was indicted on May 24, after three students testified against him at the grand jury, at Scopes' behest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1997|p=89,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Edward J. Larson]], Judge John T. Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and &quot;...all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|1997|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scopes was charged with having taught from the chapter on evolution to an April 7, 1925, high school class in violation of the Butler Act (and nominally arrested, though never detained).  His bail of $500 was paid by Paul Patterson, owner of the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' May 26, 1925: 1, 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Camp, pp81–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[prosecutor]]s were Scopes' friends, Herbert E. and [[Sue K. Hicks]], two brothers who were local attorneys, but the prosecution would be ultimately led by [[Tom Stewart]], a graduate of [[Cumberland School of Law]], who later became a U.S. Senator.

Hoping to attract  major press coverage, George Rappleyea went so far as to write to the [[United Kingdom|British]] novelist [[H. G. Wells]] asking him to join the defense team. Wells replied that he had no legal training in Britain, let alone in America, and declined the offer. However, John R. Neal, a law school professor from [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], announced that he would act as Scopes' attorney—whether Scopes liked it or not—and became the nominal head of the defense team.

[[Baptist]] pastor [[William Bell Riley]], the founder and president of the [[World Christian Fundamentals Association]], was instrumental in calling lawyer and three-time [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate and lifelong [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[William Jennings Bryan]] to act as that organization's counsel.  Bryan had originally been invited by Sue Hicks to become an associate of the prosecution and Bryan had readily accepted, despite the fact he had not tried a case in thirty-six years.  As Scopes pointed out: &quot;After [Bryan] was accepted by the state as a special prosecutor in the case, there was never any hope of containing the controversy within the bounds of constitutionality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;de Camp, pp72–74, 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scopes and Presley, ''Center of the Storm'' 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, [[Clarence Darrow]], an [[agnosticism|agnostic]], volunteered his services to the defense. After many changes back and forth, the defense team consisted of Darrow, ACLU attorney [[Arthur Garfield Hays]], and [[Dudley Field Malone]], an international divorce lawyer who had worked at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] while Bryan was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

The prosecution team was led by Tom Stewart, [[district attorney]] for the 18th Circuit (and future [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]), and included, in addition to Herbert and Sue Hicks, Ben B. McKenzie and William Jennings Bryan. The trial was covered by famous journalists from the South and around the world, including [[H. L. Mencken]] for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', which was also paying part of the defense's expenses. It was Mencken who provided the trial with its most colorful labels such as the &quot;Monkey trial&quot; of &quot;the infidel Scopes.&quot; It was also the first United States trial to be broadcast on national [[Old time radio|radio]].

==Trial==

[[Image:scopes trial.jpg|right|thumb|230px|[[Clarence Darrow]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]] chat in court during the Scopes Trial.]]

The [[ACLU]] had originally intended to oppose the [[Butler Act]] on the grounds that it violated the teacher's individual rights and academic freedom, and was therefore unconstitutional. Mainly because of Clarence Darrow, this strategy changed as the trial progressed, and the earliest argument proposed by the defense once the trial had begun was that there was actually no conflict between evolution and the creation account in the Bible (a viewpoint later called [[theistic evolution]]). In support of this claim, they brought in eight experts on evolution. Other than Dr. Maynard Metcalf, a zoologist from [[Johns Hopkins University]], the judge would not allow these experts to testify in person. Instead, they were allowed to submit written statements so that their evidence could be used at the appeal. In response to this decision, Darrow made a sarcastic comment to Judge Raulston (as he often did throughout the trial) on how he had been agreeable only on the prosecution's suggestions, for which he apologized the next day, keeping himself from being found in [[contempt of court]]. 

The presiding judge John T. Raulston was accused of being biased towards the prosecution which led him to frequently clash with Darrow. On the onset of the trial Raulston quoted Genesis and the Butler Act, he also warned the Jury not to judge the merit of the law (which would become the focus of the trial) but on the violation of the act which he called a 'high misdemeanor'. The Jury Foreman himself wasn't convinced about the Act but acted as most of the jury did on the instructions of the judge. &lt;ref&gt; Larson, Edward J., &quot;Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion&quot;(1997), p. 108-109. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later stages of the trial, Clarence Darrow had largely abandoned the ACLU's original strategy  and attacked the literal interpretation of the Bible as well as Bryan's limited knowledge of other religions and science.   

Only when the case went to appeal did the defense return to the original claim that the prosecution was invalid because the law was essentially designed to benefit a particular religious group, which would be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

In what proved to be his only extensive speech of the trial, Bryan responded to this theory on behalf of the state.  Following Stewart's strategy, Bryan argued that the proposed scientific testimony was neither competent nor proper, given the legal issue in the case, which he insisted was simply whether Scopes had taught evolution in the Rhea County High School. To support his contention that evolution was morally pernicious, Bryan cited the famous [[Leopold-Loeb]] trial involving Darrow the year before the Scopes Trial. Darrow had saved two rich young child murderers from the death sentence, and Bryan cited Darrow's own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor ... Is any blame attached because somebody took [[Nietzsche]]'s philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? ... It is hardly fair to hang a 19–year–old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Plagiarized text --&gt;
Bryan chastised evolution for teaching children that humans were but one of (precisely) 35,000 types of mammals and bemoaned the fact that human beings were descended &quot;Not even from American monkeys, but from old world monkeys&quot; (''World's Most Famous Court Trial'', 174–78).

Malone responded for the defense in a speech that was universally considered the oratorical triumph of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;de Camp, p335&lt;/ref&gt; Arousing fears of &quot;inquisitions,&quot; Malone argued that the Bible should be preserved in the realm of theology and morality and not put into a course of science. In his conclusion, Malone declared that Bryan's &quot;duel to the death&quot; against evolution should not be made one-sided by a court ruling that took away the chief witnesses for the defense. Malone promised that there would be no duel because &quot;There is never a duel with the truth.&quot; The courtroom went wild when Malone finished, and Scopes declared Malone's speech to be the dramatic highpoint of the entire trial and insisted that part of the reason Bryan wanted to go on the stand was to regain some of his tarnished glory.&lt;ref&gt;Scopes and Presley, ''Center of the Storm,'' 154–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sixth day of the trial, the defense ran out of witnesses.  The judge declared that all of the defense testimony on the Bible was irrelevant and should not be presented to the jury (which had been excluded during the defense). During the court proceedings (7th day of the trial) the defense asked the judge to call Bryan as a witness to question him on the Bible as their own experts have been rendered irrelevant; Darrow had planned the day before and called Bryan a &quot;Bible expert&quot;. This move surprised those present in the court, as Bryan was a counsel for the prosecution and Bryan himself (according to a journalist reporting the trial) never made a claim of being an expert; although he did tout his knowledge of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;de Camp p412&lt;/ref&gt; This testimony revolved around several questions regarding biblical stories and Bryan's beliefs (as shown below), this testimony culminated in Bryan declaring that Darrow was using the court to &quot;slur the Bible&quot; while Darrow replied that Bryan's statements on the Bible were &quot;foolish&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Scopes, John Thomas. &quot;The world's most famous court trial, State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes; complete stenographic report of the court test of the Tennessee anti-evolution act at Dayton, July 10 to 21, 1925, including speeches and arguments of attorneys&quot; p.304. New York: Da Capo Press (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination of Bryan==
On the seventh day of the trial, Clarence Darrow took the unorthodox step of calling William Jennings Bryan, counsel for the prosecution, to the stand as a witness in an effort to demonstrate that belief in the historicity of the Bible and its many accounts of miracles was unreasonable. Bryan accepted, on the understanding that Darrow would in turn submit to questioning by Bryan.  Although Hays would claim in his autobiography that the cross-examination of Bryan was unplanned, Darrow spent the night before in preparation.  The scientists the defense had brought to Dayton and [[Charles Francis Potter]], a modernist minister who had lost a public debate on evolution with the fundamentalist preacher [[John Roach Straton]], prepared topics and questions for Darrow to address to Bryan on the witness stand.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Garfield Hays, ''Let Freedom Ring'' (New York: Liveright, 1937), 71–72; Charles Francis Potter, ''The Preacher and I'' (New York: Crown, 1951), 275–76.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kirtley Mather]], chairman of the geology department at [[Harvard]] and also a devout Baptist played Bryan and answered questions as he believed Bryan would.&lt;ref&gt;de Camp, pp364–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirtley F. Mather, &quot;Creation and Evolution,&quot; in ''Science Ponders Religion'', ed. Harlow Shapley (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1960), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Raulston had adjourned court to the stand on the courthouse lawn, ostensibly because he was &quot;afraid of the building&quot; with so many spectators crammed into the courtroom, but probably because of the stifling heat (227; Scopes and Presley 164).

===Adam and Eve===
An area of questioning involved the book of Genesis and if [[Eve (Bible)|Eve]] was actually [[Eve (Bible)#The Creation of Eve|created from Adam's rib]], where [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] got his wife, and how many people lived in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Darrow used these examples to show that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, &quot;You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan's declaration in response was &quot;The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 2002, p157&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Plagiarized text --&gt;
Stewart objected, demanding to know the legal purpose of Darrow's questioning.  Bryan, gauging the effect the session was having, snapped that its purpose was &quot;to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in the Bible.&quot; Darrow, with equal vehemence, retorted, &quot;We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States.&quot; (299)

&lt;!-- Plagiarized text --&gt;
A few more questions followed in the charged open-air courtroom.  Darrow asked where Cain got his wife; Bryan answered that he would &quot;leave the agnostics to hunt for her&quot; (302–03).  When Darrow addressed the issue of the [[Eve (Bible)#The Temptation, Fall, and Expulsion from the Garden|temptation]] of Eve by the [[Serpent (symbolism)#Judaic and Christian mythology|serpent]], Bryan insisted that the Bible be quoted verbatim rather than allowing Darrow to paraphrase it in his own terms.  However, after another angry exchange, Judge Raulston banged his gavel, adjourning court and bringing the drama to a sudden close (303–04).

==End of the trial==
The confrontation between Bryan and Darrow lasted approximately two hours on the afternoon of the seventh day of the trial. It is likely that it would have continued the following morning but for Judge Raulston's announcement that he considered the whole examination irrelevant to the case and his decision that it should be &quot;expunged&quot; from the record. Thus Bryan was denied the chance to cross-examine the defense lawyers in return, although after the trial Bryan would distribute nine questions to the press to bring out Darrow's &quot;religious attitude.&quot; The questions and Darrow's short answers were published in newspapers the day after the trial ended, with the ''New York Times'' characterizing Darrow as answering Bryan's questions &quot;with his agnostic's creed, 'I don't know,' except where he could deny them with his belief in natural, immutable law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', July 22, 1925: 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defense's final attempt to present evidence was denied, Darrow asked the judge to bring in the jury only to have them come to a guilty verdict:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We claim that the defendant is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue as to whether he taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After they were brought in, Darrow then addressed the jury, telling them that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We came down here to offer evidence in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so all we can do is to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not. . . . we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Darrow closed the case for the defense without a final summation. Under Tennessee law, when the defense waived its right to make a closing speech, the prosecution was also barred from summing up its case.

Scopes never testified since there was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later admitted that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial (Scopes 1967:59–60).

After eight days of trial, it took the jury only nine minutes to deliberate. Scopes was found guilty on July 21 and ordered to pay a [[US$]]100.00 [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] (approximately $1,165 when adjusted from 1925 for inflation).  Raulston imposed the fine before Scopes was given an opportunity to say anything about why the court should not impose punishment upon him and after Neal brought the error to the judge's attention the defendant spoke for the first and only time in court:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute.  I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can.  Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom&amp;nbsp;— that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom.  I think the fine is unjust (''World's Most Famous Court Trial'' 313).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Appeal to Supreme Court of Tennessee==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Scopes Trial --&gt;
Scopes' lawyers appealed, challenging the conviction on several grounds.

First, they argued that the statute was overly vague because it prohibited the teaching of &quot;evolution,&quot; a very broad term. The court rejected that argument, holding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolution, like [[prohibition]], is a broad term. In recent bickering, however, evolution has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution was used in this act. It is in this sense that the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the lawyers argued that the statute violated Scopes' [[constitutional right]] to [[free speech]] because it prohibited him from teaching evolution. The court rejected this argument, holding that the state was permitted to regulate his speech as an employee of the state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was an employee of the state of Tennessee or of a municipal agency of the state. He was under contract with the state to work in an institution of the state. He had no right or privilege to serve the state except upon such terms as the state prescribed. His liberty, his privilege, his immunity to teach and proclaim the theory of evolution, elsewhere than in the service of the state, was in no wise touched by this law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Third, it was argued that the terms of the Butler Act violated the [[Tennessee State Constitution]] which provided that &quot;It shall be the duty of the [[Tennessee General Assembly|General Assembly]] in all future periods of this government, to cherish literature and science.&quot; The argument was that the theory of the descent of man from a lower order of animals was now established by the preponderance of scientific thought, and that the prohibition of the teaching of such theory was a violation of the legislative duty to cherish science.

The court rejected this argument (''Scopes v. State'', 154 Tenn. 105, 1927), holding that the determination of what laws cherished science was an issue for the legislature, not the judiciary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courts cannot sit in judgment on such acts of the Legislature or its agents and determine whether or not the omission or addition of a particular course of study tends &quot;to cherish science.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth, the defense lawyers argued that the statute violated the provisions of the Tennessee Constitution that prohibited the establishment of a state religion. The Religious Preference provisions of the Tennessee Constitution (section 3 of article 1) stated that &quot;that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] was not, at the time of the ''Scopes'' decision in the 1920s, deemed applicable to the states. Thus, Scopes' constitutional defense on establishment of religion grounds rested -- and had to rest-- solely on the state constitution, as there was no federal Establishment Clause protection available to him. ''See'' [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/statcase.htm Court's opinion]. ''See generally'' [[Incorporation doctrine]] and ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (seminal U.S. Supreme Court opinion finally applying the Establishment Clause against states in 1947). See also [http://volokh.com/posts/1122414938.shtml Book Review] of Professor Larson's Pulitzer Prize winning [[Summer for the Gods]] at point 4 (&quot;The constitutional case was largely based on state constitutional law; this was before most of the Bill of Rights had been incorporated and applied to the states.&quot;); [[Cantwell v. Connecticut]] (In 1940, the first US Supreme Court case stating that the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]] is incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and is therefore applicable against the states; but only the [[Free Exercise Clause]] was involved in Cantwell); {{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom| first = Catharine | last = Cookson| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | date = 2003 | pages = 132 et seq. |isbn = 0415941814}}(explaining incorporation doctrine relative to First Amendment and incorporation of First Amendment against states in 1940s); [http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-7-4-b.html Incorporation Doctrine Explained] by Constitutional Rights Foundation (giving incorporation chronology)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the court, Chief Justice [[Grafton Green]] rejected this argument, holding that the Tennessee Religious Preference clause was designed to prevent the establishment of a state religion as had been the experience in [[Church of England|England]] and [[Church of Scotland|Scotland]] at the writing of the Constitution, and held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, the court held that while the statute ''forbade'' the teaching of evolution (as the court had defined it), it did not ''require'' the teaching of any other doctrine, so that it did not benefit any one religious doctrine or sect over the others.

Nevertheless, having found the statute to be constitutional, the court set aside the conviction on appeal because of a [[legal technicality]]: the jury should have decided the fine, not the judge, since under the state constitution, Tennessee judges could not at that time set fines above $50, and the Butler Act specified a minimum fine of $100. &lt;ref&gt;See  [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/statcase.htm Court's opinion online], at end of opinion. The court did not address the question of how the assessment of the minimum possible statutory fine, when the defendant had been duly convicted, could possibly work any prejudice against the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Green added a totally unexpected recommendation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The court is informed that the plaintiff in error is no longer in the service of the state.  We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case.  On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a [[nolle prosequi]] herein.  Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Attorney General L.D. Smith immediately announced that he would not seek a [[retrial]], while Scopes' lawyers offered angry comments on the stunning decision.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' 16 Jan. 1927: 1, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' 393 U.S. 97 (1968) that such bans contravene the Establishment Clause because their primary purpose is religious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linder Introduction&quot; /&gt; Tennessee had repealed the Butler Act the previous year.

==The Aftermath of The Trial==
===Image of science versus religion===
The trial revealed a growing chasm in American Christianity and two ways of finding truth, one &quot;biblical&quot; and one &quot;scientific.&quot; Liberals saw a division between educated, tolerant Christians and narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist Christians. However in totality, the majority of Christians denounced evolution.&lt;ref&gt; David Goetz, &quot;The Monkey Trial&quot;. ''Christian History'' 1997 16(3): 10-18. 0891-9666 &lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards (2000) contradicts the conventional view that in the wake of the Scopes trial a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint evidenced in the movie &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory and not a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups to argue for the antievolutionist position.&lt;ref&gt; Edwards (2000); Moran (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-evolution movement===
The trial escalated the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and evolutionists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. Before the Dayton trial only the [[South Carolina]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Kentucky]] legislatures had dealt with anti-evolution laws or riders to educational appropriations bills. 

After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. 

By 1927, there were 13 states, both in the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], that considered some form of anti-evolution law. At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly. While most of these efforts were rejected, both [[Mississippi]] and [[Arkansas]] put anti-evolution laws on the books after the Scopes trial that would outlive the Butler Act.&lt;ref&gt;R. Halliburton, Jr., &quot;The Adoption of Arkansas' Anti-Evolution Law,&quot; ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' 23 (Autumn 1964): 280; Ginger, ''Six Days or Forever?'', 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Butler Act ended up serving as a model for the anti-evolution crusade, and the ACLU could not find a teacher to volunteer for another test case.

In the Southwest, crusaders included ministers R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study or, at least, relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than elsewhere and persisted through the Sputnik era after 1957, which inspired increased trust in science in general and evolution in particular.&lt;ref&gt;George E. Webb, &quot;The Evolution Controversy in Arizona and California: From the 1920s to the 1980s.&quot; ''Journal of the Southwest'' 1991 33(2): 133-150. 0894-8410. See also  Christopher K. Curtis, &quot;Mississippi's Anti-Evolution Law of 1926.&quot; ''Journal Of Mississippi History'' 1986 48(1): 15-29.  &lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of evolution made a transition from the antievolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of science===
The Scopes trial had both short and long term effects in the teaching of science in schools in the United States. Though often upheld as a blow for the fundamentalists in the form of waning public opinion, the victory was not complete. &lt;ref name= &quot;Effects of the Scopes Trial&quot;&gt; Grabiner, J.V. &amp; Miller, P.D., Effects of the Scopes Trial, Science, New Series, Vol. 185, No. 4154 (Sep. 6, 1974), pp. 832-837&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ACLU had taken on the trial as a cause, in the wake of Scopes’ conviction, they were unable to find any volunteers to take on the Butler law and by 1932, the ACLU gave up. &lt;ref name= &quot;Creationism in the United States: II. The Aftermath of the Scopes Trial&quot;&gt; Moore, Randy, The American Biology Teacher, Vol. 60, No. 8 (Oct., 1998), pp. 568-577&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-evolutionary legislation was not challenged again until 1965 and in the meantime William Jennings Bryans’ cause was taken up by a number of organizations including the Bryan Bible League, the Defenders of the Christian Faith and the Ku Klux Klan. &lt;ref name=&quot;Creationism in the United States: II. The Aftermath of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt; 

The immediate effects of the trial are evident in the high school biology texts used in the second half of the 1920’s and the early 1930’s. Of the most widely used textbooks, there is only one which lists evolution in the index and in the wake of the trial, under the pressures of fundamentalist groups, the entry is countered with biblical quotations. &lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt;  The fundamentalist’s target slowly veered off of evolution in the mid 1930's. As the anti-evolutionist movement died out, biology textbooks began to include the lost evolutionary theory of Darwin. &lt;ref name=&quot;Creationism in the United States: II. The Aftermath of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt; This also corresponds to the emerging demand that science textbooks be written by scientists rather than educators or education specialists. &lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt;  

In 1958 the National Defence Education Act was passed with the encouragement of many legislators who feared the United States education system was falling behind that of the Soviet Union. The act yielded textbooks, produced in cooperation with the American Institute of Biological Sciences, which stressed the importance of evolution as the unifying principle of biology. &lt;ref name=&quot;Creationism in the United States: II. The Aftermath of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt; The new educational regime was not unchallenged. The greatest backlash was in Texas where attacks were launched in sermons and in the press. &lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt;  Complaints were lodged with the State Textbook Commission however in addition to federal support several social forces had turned in favor of Darwin’s theory including increased interest in improving public education, legal precedents separating religion and public education, and continued urbanization in the south. These forces suppressed the backlash in Texas and also led to the repeal of the Butler Law in Tennessee in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Effects of the Scopes Trial&quot;/&gt;

==Publicity and drama==
===Publicity===
[[Edward J. Larson]], a historian who won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] for his book ''Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion'', notes &quot;Like so many archetypal American events, the trial itself began as a [[publicity stunt]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The press coverage of the &quot;monkey&quot; Trial was overwhelming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p_212_213&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front pages of newspapers like the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' were dominated by the case for days.  More than 200 newspaper reporters from all parts of the country and two from [[London]] were in Dayton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p213&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-two [[Telegraphy|telegraphers]] sent out 165,000 words per day on the trial over thousands of miles of telegraph wires hung for the purpose;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p213&quot;/&gt; more words were transmitted to Britain about the Scopes trial than for any previous American event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p213&quot;/&gt;  [[Animal training|Trained]] [[chimpanzee]]s performed on the courthouse lawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p213&quot;/&gt;  Chicago's [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio station broadcast the trial with announcer Quin Ryan via [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] broadcasts for the first on-the-scene coverage of a criminal trial. Two movie cameramen had their film flown out daily in a small plane from a specially-prepared airstrip. H.L. Mencken's trial reports were heavily slanted against the prosecution and the jury which was &quot;unanimously hot for [[Genesis]].&quot; He mocked the town's inhabitants as &quot;yokels&quot; and &quot;morons.&quot; He called Bryan a &quot;buffoon&quot; and his speeches &quot;theologic bilge.&quot; In contrast, he called the defense &quot;eloquent&quot; and &quot;magnificent.&quot; Some [[creationism|creationists]] have claimed that Mencken's trial reports turned public opinion against creationism..&lt;ref&gt; S. L.  Harrison, &quot;The Scopes 'Monkey Trial' Revisited: Mencken and the Editorial Art of Edmund Duffy.&quot; ''Journal Of American Culture'' 1994 17(4): 55-63. &lt;/ref&gt;

The media's portrayal of Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan, and the play and movie ''Inherit the Wind'', caused millions of Americans to ridicule religious-based opposition to the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial also brought publicity to the town of Dayton, Tennessee, and was hatched as a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson_2004_p_212_213&quot;/&gt; From ''The Salem Republican,'' June 11, 1925:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The whole matter has assumed the portion of Dayton and her merchants endeavoring to secure a large amount of notoriety and publicity with an open question as whether Scopes is a party to the plot or not.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Court house===
At the site of the trial, the [[Rhea County Courthouse]] in Dayton, a $1-million restoration project was completed in 1979 which restored the second-floor courtroom to its original appearance during the Scopes trial. A museum of trial events in its basement contains such memorabilia as the microphone used to broadcast the trial, trial records, photographs, and an audiovisual history. Every July local people re-enact key moments in the courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/places/scopes_museum |title=Scopes Trial Museum&amp;nbsp;– Tennessee History for Kids |publisher=Tnhistoryforkids.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In front of the courthouse stands a commemorative plaque erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;center&gt;2B 23 &lt;br /&gt;THE SCOPES TRIAL

Here, from July 10 to 21, 1925 John&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Scopes, a County High School&lt;br /&gt; teacher, was tried for teaching that&lt;br /&gt; a man descended from a lower order&lt;br /&gt; of animals in violation of a lately&lt;br /&gt; passed state law.  William Jennings&lt;br /&gt; Bryan assisted the prosecution;&lt;br /&gt; Clarence Darrow, Arthur Garfield&lt;br /&gt; Hays, and Dudley Field Malone the&lt;br /&gt; defense.  Scopes was convicted.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rhea County Courthouse was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] in 1976.&lt;ref name = NHLlist&gt;[[National Park Service]] (April 2007). &quot;National Historic Landmarks Survey: List of National Historic Landmarks by State&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.&lt;ref name = NRIS&gt;{{cite web  | last = National Park Service  | first =   | authorlink = National Park Service  | coauthors =   | title = ?  | work = National Register Information System  | publisher =   | date =   | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/research/index.htm  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
Anticipating that Scopes would be found guilty, the press fitted the defendant for martyrdom and created an onslaught of ridicule. ''Time'''s initial coverage of the trial focused on Dayton as &quot;the fantastic cross between a circus and a holy war.&quot; ''Life'' adorned its masthead with monkeys reading books and proclaimed, &quot;the whole matter is something to laugh about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;E.S. Martin, ''Life'' 86 (July 16, 1925): 16..&lt;/ref&gt;  Hosts of cartoonists added their own portrayals to the attack (the greatest collection of cartoons available would be the 14 reprinted in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[The Great Monkey Trial]]''). Both ''[[Literary Digest]]'' and the popular humor magazine ''Life'' (1890–1930) ran compilations of jokes and humorous observations garnered from newspapers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Life Lines,&quot; ''Life'' 85 (June 18, 1925): 10; 85 (June 25, 1925): 6, 86 (July 2, 1925): 8; 86 (July 9, 1925): 6; 86 (July 30, 1925): 6; &quot;Life's Encyclopedia,&quot; ''Life'' 85 (July 25, 1925): 23; Kile Croak, &quot;My School in Tennessee,&quot; ''Life'' 86 (July 2, 1925); 4; Arthur Guiterman, &quot;Notes for a Tennessee Primer,&quot; ''Life'' 86 (July 16, 1925): 5; &quot;Topics in Brief,&quot; ''Literary Digest,'' for 86 (July 4, 1925): 18; 86 (July 11, 1925): 15; 86 (July 18, 1925): 15; 86 (July 25, 1925): 15, 86 (August 1, 1925): 17; 86 (August 8, 1925): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwhelmingly, the butt of these jokes was the prosecution and those aligned with it: Bryan, the city of Dayton, the state of Tennessee, and the entire South, as well as fundamentalist Christians and anti-evolutionists. Rare exceptions were found in the Southern press, where the fact that Darrow had saved [[Leopold and Loeb]] from the death penalty continued to be a source of ugly humor.  The most widespread form of this ridicule was directed at the inhabitants of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tennessee Goes Fundamentalist,&quot; ''New Republic'' 42 (April 29, 1925): 258–60; Howard K. Hollister, &quot;In Dayton, Tennessee,&quot; ''Nation'' 121 (July 8, 1925): 61–62; Dixon Merritt, &quot;Smoldering Fires,&quot; ''Outlook'' 140 (July 22, 1925): 421–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Life'' described Tennessee as &quot;not up to date in its attitude to such things as evolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Life'' 86 (July 16, 1925: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Time'' related Bryan's arrival in town with the disparaging comment, &quot;The populace, Bryan's to a moron, yowled a welcome.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Great Trial,&quot; ''Time'' 6 (July 20, 1926): 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attacks on Bryan were predictably frequent and nasty: ''Life'' awarded him its &quot;Brass Medal of the Fourth Class,&quot; for having &quot;successfully demonstrated by the alchemy of ignorance hot air may be transmuted into gold, and that the Bible is infallibly inspired except where it differs with him on the question of wine, women, and wealth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' 86 (July 9, 1925): 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Papers across the country routinely dismissed the efforts of both sides in the trial, while the European press reacted to the entire affair with amused condescension.

Famously vituperative attacks came from the literary gadfly H.L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for the ''Baltimore Sun'' drew vivid caricatures of the &quot;backward&quot; local populace, referring to the people of Rhea county as &quot;Babbits,&quot; &quot;morons,&quot; &quot;peasants,&quot; &quot;hill-billies,&quot; &quot;yaps&quot; and &quot;yokels.&quot;  He chastised the &quot;degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls.&quot;  The nicest thing Mencken managed to say about the community was that &quot;The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Kemler, ''The Irreverent Mr. Mencken'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1948), 175–90.  For excerpts from Mencken's reports see William Manchester, ''Sage of Baltimore: The Life and Riotous Times of H.L. Mencken'' (New York: Andrew-Melrose, 1952) 143–45, and ''D-Days at Dayton: Reflections on the Scopes Trial'', ed. Jerry R. Tompkins (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1965) 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mencken attempted to perpetuate a hoax, distributing flyers for the &quot;Rev. Elmer Chubb,&quot; but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton and only the ''[[Commonweal]]'' bit.&lt;ref&gt;H.L. Mencken, ''Heathen Days, 1890–1936'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1943) 231–34; Michael Williams, &quot;Sunday in Dayton,&quot; ''Commonweal'' 2 (July 29, 1925): 285–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mencken's most venomous assault was his withering obituary of Bryan, &quot;In Memoriam: W.J.B,&quot; in which Mencken became one of the few people ever to accuse Bryan of insincerity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In Memoriam: W.J.B.&quot; was first printed in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', July 27, 1925; rpt. by Mencken in the ''American Mercury'' 5 (October 1925);: 158–60 and in his ''Prejudices (Fifth Series),'' 64–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan &quot;as a quack pure and unadulterated&quot; was &quot;really just,&quot; but the damage could hardly be undone.&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, ''Heathen Days,'' 280–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general fire from the Southern press.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mencken Epithets Rouse Dayton's Ire,&quot; ''New York Times'', July 17, 1925, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch &quot;All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Battle Now Over, Mencken Sees;
Genesis Triumphant and Ready

===Stage and film===
The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1955), by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee]] was loosely based on this trial. The play turned Darrow and Bryan into characters named Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/SCO_INHE.HTM Notes on Inherit the Wind] UMKC Law School. Retrieved April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In its preface (&quot;disclaimer&quot;) the play claims to be both unbiased and not based on any actual event. The play was made into a 1960 film directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], with [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Fredric March]] as Drummond and Brady.  There have also been a trio of television versions, with [[Melvyn Douglas]] and [[Ed Begley]] in 1965, [[Jason Robards]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] in 1988, and [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[George C. Scott]] in 1999.  The Scopes trial did not appear in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' until 1957, when its inclusion was spurred by the successful run of ''Inherit the Wind'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], which was mentioned in the citation. It was not until the 1960s that the Scopes trial began to be mentioned in the history textbooks of American high schools and colleges, usually as an example of the conflict between fundamentalists and modernists, and often in sections that also talked about the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrance Bernabo and Celeste Michelle Condit (1990).  &quot;Two Stories of the Scopes Trial: Legal and Journalistic Articulations of the Legitimacy of Science and Religion&quot; in ''Popular Trials: Rhetoric, Mass Media, and the Law'', edited by Robert Hariman.  Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, the city of Dayton has staged a reenactment of the trial using the original transcripts, performing it in the very same courtroom in which the trial took place.  The annual event occurs during Dayton's Scopes Trial festival with several performances showing over the weekend.  In 2007, [[Bryan College]], the institute founded in memory of Bryan, purchased the rights to the production and made a filmed version for DVD release using the same performers entitled &quot;Inherit the Truth&quot; in an attempt to clear up any misunderstandings regarding the trial due to ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bryan.edu/4290.html|title=Bryan offers DVD of 'Inherit the Truth'|accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cultural evolutionism attempts to describe and explain long-term change in human ways of life, insofar as those ways are socially rather than biologically acquired. Though often used interchangeably with the terms &quot;social evolution&quot; and &quot;[[sociocultural evolution]],&quot; the term &quot;cultural evolution&quot; sometimes is useful for specifying a focus on long-term change not in properties of a social group as such (e.g., its sheer size or location), but in the way of life--the characteristic artifacts, behaviors, and ideas--''of'' the group. Defined this way, cultural evolutionism is not inherently ethnocentric, though of course the cultural past can be--and all too often has been--interpreted ethnocentrically. Today, many archaeologists, some cultural anthropologists, and even some sociologists are self-identified cultural evolutionists; and many more scholars are shown, by virtue of their research interests, to fit this definition.

'''''The Ancestor's Tale''''' (subtitled ''A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life'') is a 2004 [[popular science]] [[book]] by [[Richard Dawkins]], with contributions from Dawkins' research assistant Yan Wong. It follows the path of [[human]]s backwards through [[evolution]]ary history, meeting humanity's cousins as they converge on common ancestors. The book was nominated for the [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books#2005 Winners|2005 Aventis Prize for Science Books]].

==Synopsis==

The narrative is structured as a [[pilgrimage]], with all modern animals following their own path through history to the [[origin of life]]. Humans meet their evolutionary cousins at rendezvous points along the way, the points at which the lineage diverged. At each point Dawkins attempts to infer, from molecular and [[fossil]] evidence, the probable form of the [[most recent common ancestor]] and describes the modern animals that join humanity's growing travelling party. This structure is inspired by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.

The pilgrimage visits a total of 40 &quot;rendezvous points&quot; from rendezvous zero, the most recent common ancestor of all of humanity, to rendezvous 39, [[eubacteria]], the ancestor of all surviving organisms. Though Dawkins is confident of the essential shape of this [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic taxonomy]], he enters caveats on a small number of branch points where a compelling weight of evidence had not been assembled at the time of writing.

At each rendezvous point, Dawkins recounts interesting tales about cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited [[species]], [[genus]] or [[Family (biology)|family]] has its own peculiar features to offer as amusement for readers. For instance, Dawkins discusses why the [[axolotl]] never needs to grow up, how new [[species]] come about, how hard it is to classify animals, and why our [[fish]]-like ancestors decided to move on to land. These peculiar features are studied and analyzed using a newly introduced tool or method from [[evolutionary biology]], carefully woven into the tale to illustrate how the few simple assumptions of [[Darwinian]] [[evolution]] can explain all diversity in nature.

Even though the book is best read sequentially, every chapter can also be read independently as a self-contained tale with an emphasis on a particular aspect of modern biology. As a whole, the book elaborates on all major topics in evolution. ''The Ancestor's Tale'' can be considered an [[encyclopedia]] on evolution disguised as a collection of fascinating stories.

Dawkins also tells personal stories about his childhood and time at [[university]]. He talks with fondness about a tiny [[Galago|bushbaby]] he kept as a child in [[Malawi]] (Nyasaland). He described his surprise when he learned that the closest living relatives to the [[hippopotamus|hippos]] are the [[whales]]. 

The book was produced in two hardback versions: a British one with extensive colour illustrations (by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), and an American one with a reduced number of black-and-white illustrations (by Houghton Mifflin). Paperback versions and an abridged audio version (narrated by Dawkins and his wife [[Lalla Ward]]) have also been published.

The book is dedicated to Dawkins' friend and mentor, [[population genetics|population geneticist]] [[John Maynard Smith]], who died shortly before the book went to press.

==List of rendezvous points==

Dawkins uses the term ''concestor''—coined by Nicky Warren—for the [[most recent common ancestor]] at each rendezvous point. At each rendezvous point, we meet the concestor of ourselves and the listed species or collection of species. This does not mean that the concestor was much like those creatures; after the &quot;rendezvous&quot;, our fellow &quot;pilgrims&quot; have had as much time to evolve and change as we have. Only creatures alive at the time of the book's writing join us at each rendezvous point. Except for a few special cases, numerous extinct species and families such as the [[dinosaur]]s are excluded from the pilgrimage.

The tale ends with yet another example of trans-specific polymorphism: [[sexual dimorphism]]; the [[Sex-determination system|sex-determining]] [[SRY]] has never been in female bodies long since gibbons and humans diverged. This serves to highlight the fact that different phylogenetic trees can be created by [[Coalescent theory|tracing different sets of genes]]; the one mainstream 'species tree' is nothing more than a summary of multitude of gene trees, a 'majority vote' among gene trees. Gibbon is the last [[ape]] to join the pilgrimage.

| '''The [[Howler Monkey]]'s Tale''' calls attention to the critical role of [[gene duplication]] in evolution. While our remote [[vertebrate]] ancestors possessed [[trichromacy|trichromatic vision]], our [[nocturnal]], [[warm-blooded]], [[mammal]]ian ancestors lost one of three [[Cone cell|cones]] in the [[retina]] at the time of [[dinosaur]]s. This is why [[fish]], [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s are trichromatic while all mammals with the exception of [[apes]] and New World monkeys are strictly handicapped [[dichromacy|dichromats]]. Because [[color vision]] is of paramount importance to [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] animals that eat ripe fruits, apes and New World monkeys regained tri-color vision independently via [[chromosomal translocation]]. In apes, trichromacy resulted from true duplication of the [[opsin]] gene. New World monkeys first achieved trichromacy in its female population by producing two alleles (green and red) for the same [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] for the opsin gene on the [[X-chromosome]], an example of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]. Its males, with only one copy of the X-chromosome, remained dichromats with either a green or a red opsin, an example of [[heterozygote advantage]]. Howler monkeys, a type of New World monkey, took this one step further and achieved trichromacy for both sexes when its X-chromosome gained two [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] to house both the green allele and the red allele. New World monkeys are the last [[simian]]s (also known as 'higher [[primate]]s' or [[anthropoid]]s) to join the pilgrimage.

| Tarsier is the last [[Haplorrhini|haplorrhine]] to join the pilgrimage. A nocturnal animals, the tarsier has two enormous eyes each as large as its brain. Unlike other [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] mammals, however, tarsier eyes do not contain [[tapetum lucidum]] which reflects light from the back of the eye for a second exposure on the [[retina]] to maximize light capture. From this we can infer that the common ancestor of all haplorrhine must have been a [[diurnal animal]] which shed the tapetum lucidum to eliminate blurry images caused by reflected light. When the tarsier became a nocturnal animal, it enlarged its eyes to compensate for the lack of tapetum lucidum.

| The pilgrimage meets with the rest of the [[prosimian]] cousins: the [[lemur]]s, [[potto]]s, [[Galago|bushbabies]], and [[loris]]es. '''The [[Aye-Aye]]'s Tale''' showcases the strange [[lemur]]s which are only found on the island of [[Madagascar]]. Madagascar was originally part of the [[Gondwana]] [[supercontinent]] which included present [[Africa]] [[continent]] and [[Indian subcontinent]]. Gondwana broke off into drifting blocks of land, some of which became Africa, India and Madagascar. As an estranged island, Madagascar became a [[speciation]] hotbed. For instance a small [[Founder effect|founding population]] of [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] primates (possibly rafted in from neighboring continent) flourished and diversified into all niches of the [[ecosystem]], in the absence of monkeys. The story reminds us how Madagascar, with a [[land mass]] 1/1000 of [[Earth]]'s total land area, ends up housing unique species that account for 4% of all species of animals and plants. Lemurs and their kin are the last of the [[primate]]s to join the pilgrimage.

| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Colugo]] and [[Treeshrew|Tree Shrews]]
| The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]] occurred at 65 million years ago, due to both large scale [[volcano|volcanic]] activities in the [[Deccan traps]] over a period of time, and the final [[asteroid]] [[impact event]] which created the [[Chicxulub Crater]]. The sudden temperature change and sunlight reduction caused massive disruptions to Earth's ecosystem. As a result, all [[dinosaur]]s except the [[bird]]s, as well as numerous other species went [[extinct]]. The disappearance of dinosaurs made it possible for many different species of [[shrew]]-like, nocturnal [[insectivore]]s to evolve into [[hippopotamus|hippos]], [[lion]]s, [[elephant]]s, etc. to fill the new ecological voids, an example of [[evolutionary radiation]]. One of these shrew-like creatures was the concestor of the current pilgrimage party and the new joiners, the colugos and tree shrews.
|-
| The [[tree shrews]] resemble the [[squirrel]]s. The [[colugos]] resemble [[flying squirrel]]s. In both cases, the resemblance is only superficial, due to [[Convergent evolution|convergence]]; the squirrels are [[rodent]]s and will meet us further down the pilgrimage. At the present, scientists are not yet sure about the exact relationships among the tree shrews, the colugos and us. Dawkins provisionally accepts the view that they join forces first, before meeting the pilgrimage party. This would place our concestor 9 at a time before [[K-T boundary]] which marked the extinction of the dinosaurs. '''The Colugo's Tale''' warns us that even though the general structure of the family tree is sound, some of the details could change as more evidences become known.

| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Rodent]]s and [[Lagomorpha|Rabbitkind]]
| [[Rodent]]s comprise the largest number of species in [[mammal]]ia, more than 40 percent of all mammalian species. Members include [[rat]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[lemming]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[squirrel]]s, etc. '''The Mouse's Tale''' explains how mammals possess similar and relatively small [[genome]]s in the order of 30,000 [[gene]]s, yet each animal exhibits distinct features and surprising complexities. Dawkins debunks the popular description of genome as [[blueprint]]s which give rise to the misconception that the more complex the animal, the more complex the blueprint ought to be. Instead, genes in a genome should be thought of as [[word]]s or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a [[language]], and [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] over time is akin to 'order' of words and sentences in a book. While the number of genes are limited, the endless number of 'orders' by which similar genes in mice and humans are deployed during embryonic development can generate astonishing complexity and distinguish a mouse from a man.
|-
| '''The Beavers's Tale''' revisits the key insights that Dawkins contributed to the field of evolution in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. A beaver's body is known as a [[phenotype]], an external and visible manifestation of the internal and hidden [[genotype]]. In the same way the beaver [[organism|body]] is regarded as an expression of its genes, [[Beaver dam#Dams|beaver dams]] or beaver [[lake]]s can be considered 'extended phenotypes' of the same beaver genes. Better beaver genes make better beaver bodies, beaver dams and beaver lakes. In other words, beaver genes are selected not only by the fitness of beaver bodies, but also by the effectiveness of beaver dams and beaver lakes they produce.

| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Laurasiatheria|Laurasiatheres]]
| An extremely diverse group of animals join the pilgrimage, including [[Carnivora]] ([[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[bear]]s and [[Pinniped|seals]]), [[Perissodactyla]] ([[horse]]s, [[tapir]]s and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]]), [[Cetartiodactyla]] ([[deer]], [[cattle]], [[pig]]s and [[Hippopotamus|hippos]]), [[Chiroptera]] ([[bat]]s), [[Insectivora]] ([[Mole (animal)|moles]] and [[shrew]]s), etc. Some of them [[Flight|fly]], others [[Ability to swim|swim]], and yet many of them [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]]. Half of them are [[Predation|predators]] which hunt the other half of the group. The only thing they share in common is that they join up with one another before the group joins us to meet concestor 11. This group of animals belong to the [[Laurasiatheria]] clade as all of them originated from the [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]]. 
|-
| '''The [[Hippopotamus|Hippo]]'s Tale''' is really the [[whale]]'s tale. All [[cetacea]]ns, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, are descendants of land-living [[mammals]] of the [[Artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed ungulate animals). Both cetaceans and artiodactyl are now classified under the super-order [[Cetartiodactyla]] which includes both whales and [[hippopotamus|hippos]]. In fact, whales are the closest living relatives of hippos; they evolved from a [[Most recent common ancestor|common ancestor]] at around 54 million years ago. This story illustrates how a species can flip into evolutionary overdrive when it enters into a new environment, while its closest relatives remain unchanged for long time in their static environment.
|-
| '''The [[Pinniped|Seal]]'s Tale''' illustrates how a [[sex ratio]] of 50:50 (males to females) is found in most [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] animals from both [[Monogamy|monogamous]] and [[Polygamy|polygamous]] species. In a harem-based ([[Polygyny|polygynous]]) system such as that of [[elephant seal]]s where 4 percent of males account for 88 percent of all copulations, the actual sex ratio of 50:50 seems to produce an excess of males who consume resources but end up leaving no offsprings. This puzzle is solved by the concept of [[parental expenditure]] proposed by [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]]. More importantly, the elephant seal typifies [[sexual dimorphism]], as a bull elephant seal can grow to be three times the size of a cow seal, thanks to [[sex-limited genes]] which exist in both male and female bodies, but remain turned off in females. The degree of sexual dimorphism is correlated with the harem size, which allows us to draw inferences about our immediate human ancestors: they were probably mildly polygynous.

| '''The [[Armadillo]]'s Tale''' reminds us of the [[aye-aye]]'s tale, except that instead of [[Madagascar]], the [[speciation]] hotbed is the continent of [[South America]]. This continent broke off from [[Gondwana]] in Early [[Cretaceous]] period, then joined [[North America]] which broke off from [[Laurasia]]. During its long period of isolation, South America was host to [[marsupial]]s which flourished and took up all [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[Ecological niche|niches]]. The [[Eutheria|placental mammals]] (including armadillo) and now-extinct [[Meridiungulata|ungulate]]s evolved to fill the rest of the ecosystem. When South America joined North America during the [[Great American Interchange]] at 3 million years ago, animals and plants cross the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in both directions, introducing new species to new land and driving some local species to extinction. [[Jaguar]]s and other [[Carnivora|carnivorous]] placental mammals were introduced to South America, while armadillos migrated to North America.

The concestor we greet at this point, as well as those we met earlier at rendezvous 12 and 11, all look like [[Insectivore|insectivorous]] [[shrew]]s.

| The entire band of placental mammals meet up with the other great group of mammals, the [[marsupial]]s. Even though present-day marsupials are mostly found in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]], they originally flourished and diversified for a period of time in [[South America]]. Evidence points to the migration of a single species of [[Didelphimorphia|opossum]]-like marsupial from South America to Australia before 55 million years ago, when it was still possible to make the journey through [[Antarctica]] before Australia [[Continental drift|pulled]] too far away from [[Gondwana]]. Once settled in the isolated Australia, the [[Founder effect|founding]] marsupials quickly evolved into distinct species and, for the next 40 million years, took up the entire range of 'trades' previously occupied by [[dinosaur]]s, in the absence of any placental mammals.
|-
| '''The [[Marsupial Mole]]'s Tale''' again highlights the wonders that [[convergent evolution]] can create. Despite great [[genetic distance|evolutionary distance]] between marsupial moles in Australia and the [[golden mole]]s in Africa, they are remarkably similar in terms of [[phenotype]]s, with the exception that the marsupial moles sport a [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] as all marsupials do. There are also marsupial ''mice'' ([[Dasyuridae]]), marsupial ''flying squirrels'' ([[Sugar Glider]]) and marsupial ''wolf'' ([[Thylacine]]), not to mention the equivalent of [[antelope]]s and [[gazelle]]s, the [[kangaroo]]s and [[wallaby|wallabies]] which despite great differences in shape, cover the same range of diet and way of life as their African counterparts.

| The [[monotreme]]s are the last of the mammals to join us, and we meet a concestor for the first time in the then-contiguous supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. The monotremes consititutes only a few genera: [[Platypus]], [[Short-beaked Echidna]] and [[Long-beaked echidna]]. They are mammals and have typical mammalian features such as [[warm-blooded]]ness, [[hair]] and [[milk]] production. But they resemble [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s in their possession of the [[cloaca]] and their [[Egg (biology)|egg]]-laying mode of reproduction. 
|-
| '''The [[Platypus|Duckbill]]'s Tale''' warns us about the fallacy of labeling a half-mammal and half-reptile animal such as the duckbill platypus as ''[[Primitive (biology)|primitive]]''. The platypus has exactly the same time to evolve as the rest of mammals, even if it does resembles our concestor 15 on the surface. In fact, it has evolved a highly developed form of [[electroreception]] served by 40,000 electric sensors, and 60,000 [[Mechanoreceptor|mechanical push rods]], both on its large bill to aid it in search of [[crustacean]]s in the mud. In human, the brain dedicates disproportionally large amount of cells to the two hands as illustrated by the Penfield brain map, or [[Cortical homunculus|Penfield homunculus]]. When the same [[somatotopic map]] is drawn for platypus brain, the bill is served by equally prominent percentage of the brain.

| rowspan=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Sauropsid]]s
| The pilgrims are about to join their [[reptile]] cousins, after marching for 130 million unbroken years from the last mammal concestor 15 who looks like a [[shrew]] to the reptile concestor 16 who looks like a [[lizard]]. In these 130 million years, [[mammal-like reptiles]] flourished, even before [[dinosaur]]s roamed the Earth. But like the 99 percent of all species that ever existed, all branches of mammal-like reptiles are now extinct, so they cannot join us in our pilgrimage.  
|-
| The term [[reptile]] is not a true [[clade]] name, as it fails to include [[bird]]s which share a common ancestry. The terms ''reptile'' and ''fish'' are known as [[Paraphyly|grades]] which only make sense scientifically when used in the now-discredited theory of [[progressive evolution]] (Orthogenesis). Progressive evolution proposes that species evolve independently, in a parallel, progressive direction from fish grade through amphibian grade via reptile grade towards mammal grade. From a [[Cladistics|cladistic]] point of view, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[dinosaur]]s and [[bird]]s are all members of the clade ''[[Sauropsids]]'' which is what Dawkins adapts instead of the term ''reptile''. Dinosaurs, unfortunately as extinct species, cannot join us. But their only surviving descendants, the birds, take their place in the pilgrimage.
|-
| '''The [[Darwin's finches|Galapagos Finch]]'s Tale''' addresses a surprising question: why doesn't evolution go much faster than it does? Studies on Galapagos finches show that the [[Medium Ground-finch]] (Geospiza fortis) could grow to be as large as the [[Large Ground-finch]] (Geospiza magnirostris), if 23 consecutive [[drought]] years put pressure on birds to grow larger [[beak]]s to better handle bigger and tougher seeds. But such extreme evolutionary speed is not observed in nature, given the [[Geologic time scale|geological time]] life has had on Earth. This is mostly because the [[:Category:Rate of evolution|rate of evolution]] follows major trends over geological timescale, while short-term pressures tend to cancel out one another.  
|-
| '''The [[Peafowl|Peacock]]'s Tale''' is the quintessential illustration of [[sexual selection]]; the peacock's tail is the ultimate example of non-utilitarian phenotype which appears to be an anomaly in [[natural selection]], as it is a hindrance to peacock's [[Survival of the fittest|survival]] in its natural habitat. These arbitrary spurts of evolution can be explained by sexual selection, a special case of natural selection. The [[Chain reaction|runaway explosion]] of the extravagant tail is created by lockstep [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic selections]] of male's genes for pretty tails and of female's genes for preferring such tails. The preference for pretty tails, in turns, is rooted in their use by males as tokens of underlying [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]; an advertisement of [[health]]. Sexual selection often complements other natural selection forces, and helps explain why [[human]] became [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] to free the two hands for [[tool]] making and wielding, attained a larger [[human brain|brain]] with [[Hominid intelligence|artistic abilities]], and shed body [[hair]] to advertise lack of [[Parasitism|ectoparasites]] during the course of [[human evolution]].
|-
| '''The [[Dodo]]'s Tale''' illustrates how evolution optimizes genes for the present environment, how it has no foresight, and how it [[The Blind Watchmaker|marches blindly]] sometimes to the detriment of the species. The dodo, originally a [[Bird flight|flying]] [[Columbidae|pigeon]] related to the [[Rodrigues Solitaire]], reached the remote island of [[Mauritius]] and shed its flying powers due to the lack of competition and natural [[Predation|predator]]s to become a [[Flightless bird]]. The reallocation of resources away from building of massive breast [[muscle]]s for flying allowed the dodo to flourish, but ultimately lead to their extinction when European sailors and their carnivorous pets finally arrived. 
|-
| '''The [[Elephant Bird]]'s Tale''' demonstrates how enigmatic distributions of [[Genetic distance|genetically close]] species in completely separate continents can be explained and corroborated by evidences of [[continental drift]] and [[seafloor spreading]]. The tale recounts the diaspora of a large group of [[flightless bird|flightless]] [[ratite|ratite birds]] from the then unbroken [[Gondwana]]; [[Moa]] ended up in [[New Zealand]], [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]] in [[South America]], [[emu]] in [[Australia]], [[cassowary]] in [[New Guinea]], [[kiwi]] in [[New Zealand]] by [[island hopping]], and [[ostrich]] in [[Africa]] by way of Asia and Europe.  [[Radiometric dating|Radioactive dating]] of and magnetic striping studies on continuously formed [[Crust (geology)|crust]] around [[rift]]s such as the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] allow [[Biogeography|Paleobiogeographers]] to piece back a coherent story of these birds' dispersion based on both [[phylogenetic tree]] and [[plate tectonics]].

| rowspan=&quot;4&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Amphibian]]s
| Mammals and reptiles (the [[amniote]]s) join the [[amphibian]]s to meet the ancestor of all land [[vertebrates]] with four feet, the [[tetrapod]]. Amphibians include [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s and [[caecilian]]s. While amniotes either give [[live birth]]s or lay waterproof eggs, the amphibians retain the ancestral practice of laying eggs in water. Unlike the waterproof skin of amniotes, the amphibian skin allows body water to [[evaporate]] through it, restricting amphibians to land areas with access to [[fresh water]].
|-
| '''The [[Salamander]]'s Tale''' uses examples of [[ring species]] to illustrate how a continuous series of [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]] animals in the [[space|spatial]] dimension is conceptually equivalent to that in the [[time]] dimension. The ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] in [[California]] form a continuous ring (actually a [[horseshoe]] shape) around the valley. Any two neighboring population of ''Ensatina'' around the horseshoe can [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]], but the plain ''Ensatina eschscholtzii'' on the western end of the horseshoe cannot interbreed with the large blotched ''Ensatina klauberi'' on the eastern end.  [[Larus]] gulls form another ring species which starts at [[Herring Gull]] in [[Great Britain]] and ends at [[Lesser Black-backed Gull]] in north-western [[Europe]]. Dawkins likens both ring species in space to the ring in time that unites [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s via generations of ancestors over 6 million years, with concestor 1 in the midpoint.
|-
| '''The Narrowmouth's Tale''' shows how [[speciation]] may still continue via [[parapatric speciation]], when two closely related toad species meet again after initial [[geographical isolation]].  ''[[Gastrophryne olivacea]]'' (Great Plains narrowmouth toad) and ''[[Gastrophryne carolinensis]]'' (Eastern narrowmouth toad) are closely related and can interbreed when their habitats overlap. But ''reinforcement'', a selection process which increases [[reproductive isolation]] via [[character displacement]], causes both species to differentiate their mating calls from each other by shifting pitch and duration in opposite directions; the more the two populations overlap, the more distinct their mating calls become.
|-
| '''The [[Axolotl]]'s Tale''' is about [[metamorphosis]], a [[biological process]] which turns [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] or [[larva]]e into drastically dissimilar [[adult]] forms for [[reproduction]], and about [[pedomorphosis]], another process which enables juveniles of some species to become [[sexual maturity|sexually-mature]] without ever developing into their usual adult forms. Species which undergo metamorphosis include [[butterflies]], [[barnacle]]s and [[salamander]]s. Species which exhibit [[neoteny]], a type of pedomorphosis, include [[human]], [[ostrich]], [[pekingese]] and [[axolotl]]. A text book example of neoteny, the [[axolotl]]s are members of the [[Tiger Salamander]] complex, yet they become sexually-mature in larva form, remaining aquatic and [[external gills|gilled]]. With a treatment of [[thyroxine]], it is possible to induce an axolotl to develop into a salamander, demonstrating that axolotl genome still retains information on its lost adult form. On the other hand, [[newt]], a type of salamander, first develops from [[tadpole]] into land-based salamander, but later reverts back to its juvenile tadpole form, and returns to the water to reproduce. The axolotl's tale reminds us that paedomorphosis often allows species to break out of an evolutionary dead end by sudden changes.

The lungfish joins the pilgrimage to meet concestor 18, before the coelacanth joins at rendezvous point 19. Instead of looking like members from the pilgrimage, the lungfish actually resembles coelacanth and concestor 19, the lobe-finned fish [[Sarcopterygii]]. Despite their [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities, however, the lungfish and coelacanth are very different [[Molecular genetics|genetically]], as expected of species which lived separately for more than 400 million years. Because genes do not stop evolving, the molecular DNA of these two species show greater [[Genetic distance|evolutionary distance]] from each other than to DNA of the rest of the pilgrimage. '''The Lungfish's Tale''' reminds us that the rate of morphological changes is not always obviously correlated with that of genetic change.

| The current pilgrimage consisting of all descendants of [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] is joined by the equally successful [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]] which includes [[sturgeon]], [[paddlefish]], [[eel]], [[herring]], [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[seahorse]], [[cod]], etc. to meet concestor 19, the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]]. Of all ray-finned fishes, most belong to the large [[infraclass]] [[teleostei]].
|-
| Some [[teleostei|teleost]] fishes evolved unfishy shapes to cope with their chosen ecological niches. The [[leafy sea dragon]], for instance, abandons the typical streamline fish shape which works so well for the majority of fishes. Instead, it adopts a leafy shape to hang motionless in [[kelp forest]], pretending to be a piece of [[seaweed]]. The [[Shrimpfish|razorfish]] takes up an elongated, laterally compressed body, together with a long, flattened [[snout]]. It swims in a head-down vertical stance, allowing it to hide amongst tall spines of a [[sea urchin]]. The [[snipe eel]] is ridiculously thin, while the [[gulper eel]] sports jaws which look disproportionally large for its body. Lastly, the [[ocean sunfish]] resembles a huge, two-ton disc or millstone, as its Latin name, ''Mola mola'', suggests. '''The Leafy Sea Dragon's Tale''' demonstrates how animal shapes are malleable, ever changing to meet the requirements of each animal's way of life.
|-
| '''The [[Esox|Pike]]'s Tale''' highlights a special organ which gives teleost fishes superior [[buoyancy]] control, the [[gas bladder|swim bladder]]. Contrary to common assumptions, swim bladder is not a precursor to [[lung]]s in human and other lobe-finned fishes. Instead, the bony fish ancestor possessed a primitive lung which was [[Exaptation|co-opted]] by teleost fishes for buoyancy control, and in some cases as [[ear drum]] for [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. The teleost fishes rely on [[gill]]s for [[breath]]ing underwater. They repurposed the primitive lung, turning its ability to absorb from and release gas into the [[blood]] stream into a volume-changing mechanism, thus allowing teleost fishes to move vertically in a [[water column]] without the use of fins.
|-
| '''The [[Mudskipper]]'s Tale''' shows how animals rediscover long lost faculties and reenact ancient evolutionary events via completely different biological mechanisms. Having forgone air-breathing by repurposing the lung for buoyancy control, some teleost fishes, such as the [[Siamese fighting fish]] (''Betta splendens''), reinvent air-breathing by gulping air and locally [[oxygenate|oxygenerating]] water in the [[gill]] chamber. The mudskipper ''Periophthalmus'' not only takes air into its moist gill chamber, but can also breathe through its skin. Both the gill chamber and the skin must be wet at all times, and this distinguishes the new type of air-breathing from breathing through [[lung]]s. Re-equipped with air-breathing apparatus, the mudskipper emerges onto land, replaying ancient lobefin's conquest of the land.
|-
| The rapid speciation of [[haplochromine]] [[cichlid]] fishes [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Lake Victoria]], [[Lake Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] exemplifies [[adaptive radiation]] and [[species flock]]. '''The Cichlid's Tale''' recounts how, by constructing an &quot;unrooted haplotype network&quot; using [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]] on mitocondrial DNA of living species from regional rivers and lakes, researchers were able to infer the time and the location of each major speciation event in the evolutionary history of these cichlids. The haplotype network differs from normal [[phylogenetic tree]] in that each node represents a [[haplotype]], not a species, and the node size is determined by number of species in which the haplotype is found. By analyzing genetic relationships between haplotypes, relative prevalence of each haplotype, and locations where species currently live, it is possible to trace past waves of adaptive radiation originating from a small founding species, as rivers and lakes rose and fell in level.
|-
| '''The [[Mexican tetra|Blind Cave Fish]]'s Tale''' illustrates how normal organs can degenerate into [[vestigiality|vestigial]] organs. Different populations of [[Mexican tetra]] (''Astyanax mexicanus'') have ventured into dark caves separately, and have separately evolved regressive traits such as white skin coloration and regressive or [[blindness|blind]] eyes. This is partially explained by the [[opportunity cost]] theory; resources wasted on building the eye in a pitch-black cave deprives the fish of other traits useful for such environment. But more importantly, without [[evolutionary pressure]] to weed out bad mutations on the multitude of genes which together build the eye, any random change is more likely to disrupt the dedicate process of building the eye than to enhance it. There is no need to revert precisely the sets of genes carefully shaped by millions of years of evolution to get back to a blind creature. In other words, there are many more random ways of building a blind fish than of building a sighted one. And this is the essence of the [[Dollo's Law]] as Dawkins interprets it - that evolution cannot be ''precisely'' and ''exactly'' reversed.
|-
| '''The [[Flounder]]'s Tale''' is a tale of imperfection. The flounder's contorted head and eyes allow it to lie on its side on the ocean floor, but they betray the lack of an [[intelligent designer]].  As expounded in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]'', [[evolution]] does not 'design' every creature anew on a drawing board.  Instead, [[natural selection]] works without foresight and makes gradual improvements on existing body plans from generation to generation.  Because each creature at every step of the process must [[Fitness (biology)|remain fit]] for its environment, evolution cannot make sudden and drastic changes to build a better future organism at the expense of current generation.

|Cartilaginous fishes [[chondrichthyan]] including [[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]] and [[chimaera]]s join the pilgrimage in the [[Middle Ordovician]].  The newcomers have no bones. Instead, they are supported by a [[cartilaginous]] skeleton that never [[Ossification|ossifies]], in contrast to bony fishes. Their skin is covered in [[dermal denticle]]s, tiny scale-like protrusions, from which teeth may have evolved. Interestingly, sharks lack a [[swim bladder]] for buoyancy, and instead rely on swimming constantly, retaining [[urea]] in their blood, and having large livers with plenty of oil to remain afloat. The ''[[Carcharocles megalodon]]'' from the [[Miocene]] is described as a predator more terrifying than the [[Great White Shark]], as it was three times the size. The strange [[Chimaera]] has strange gill covers, has no dermal denticles, and swims using their pectoral fins. Dawkins explains that concestor 21 is ancestor to all [[gnathostomes]], animals with lower jaws, a structure which evolved from the [[gill arch]]es.

| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; | [[Lamprey]]s and [[Hagfish]]
|[[Agnatha|Jawless and limbless fishes]], the [[lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]], join the pilgrimage to meet the concestor of all [[vertebrate]]s. The jawless fish and the concestor 22 are borderline vertebrates. Unlike the rest of vertebrates, they retain the [[notochord]], a stiffening cartilage rod running along the back of an animal, well into adulthood. In all other vertebrates, the vestigial notochord appears in the embryo briefly and is replaced by segmented, articulate backbones in adults. On the other hand, both the jawless fish and the jawed fish share characteristics common to all members of the phylum [[Chordata]] at some time in their life cycle, including the [[notochord]], [[pharyngeal slit]], and the post-anal [[tail]].
|-
|'''The Lamprey's Tale''' further develops the ''gene's eye view of ancestry and pedigree'' that earlier tales, The Eve's Tale and The Gibbon's Tale, alluded to. In human, four [[haemoglobin]] genes are known to be cousin genes of each other. An ancestor globin gene from an ancient vertebrate [[Gene duplication|split]] into two genes, [[HBA1|alpha]] and [[HBB|beta]], which ended up in two different chromosomes and continued to evolve independently. Both alpha and beta further split into more independently evolving genes. All jawed fish show such alpha/beta split as predicated by evolution. However, [[lampreys]] and [[hagfish]] are ancient enough that they predate this gene split. In fact, jawless fishes, whenever investigated, do not possess split globin genes. As Dawkins explained in the chapter '[[River out of Eden#All Africa and her progenies|All Africa and her progenies]]' in his book ''[[River out of Eden]]'', there are two ways to trace ancestry: via animals and via individual genes. The two mechanisms produce very different results. Ancestry of animals form a family tree (more correctly, a [[Graph theory|graph]] because [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] animals may share female and male parents). On the other hand, Ancestry of an individual gene is always a single chain going back to the first [[RNA world hypothesis|self-replicating RNA]], since a gene is either a faithful copy or a mutated form of its single parent gene. ''The Ancestor's Tale'' is written from an animal's perspective, following the family tree of human backward in time. But the book could have been written from the gene's point of view. Starting from any gene (e.g. the alpha haemoglobin), each gene [[gene duplication]] event could become a rendezvous point where pilgrimage of genes join their cousin genes.

| [[Lancelet]]s are text book examples of a [[Chordata|chordate]]. Equipped with a notochord, a nerve tube on the dorsal side and gill slits, they typify the phylum Chordata. But lancelets are not [[Primitive (biology)|primitive]] nor our remote ancestor. They are as modern as all other members in the pilgrimage. '''The Lancelet's Tale''' continues to develop the theme introduced in The Duckbill's Tale, that all living animals have had equal time to evolve since the first concestor, and that no living animal should be described as either lower or more primitive. Dawkins extends this concept to apply to [[fossil]]s as well. Even though it is tempting to label fossils as our remote ancestor, they are more accurately described as our distant cousins who have been frozen in time.

| A [[Sea squirt]] resemble a sedentary bag of sea water anchored to a rock. It feeds on food particles strained from water. Anatomically, the sea squirt looks very different to the joining pilgrimage of all vertebrates and protochordates, that is, until its larvae are examined. The sea squirt [[larva]] looks and swims like a tadpole. it possesses a notochord and a dorsal nerve tube, and moves by undulating its post-anal tail from side to side. Vertebrates may have branched off from ancient sea squirt larvae via [[neoteny]], in a process reminiscent of The Axolotl's Tale. But recent DNA analysis on [[larvacea]] favors Darwin's initial interpretation, that one branch of ancient tadpole-like protochordates evolved a new [[metamorphosis]] stage to turn into sedentary sea squirts.

Note: From the Lancelets onward, Dawkins only provides dates under duress stating that, &quot;dating becomes so difficult and controversial that my courage fails me&quot;.

|The current pilgrimage, known as [[deuterostomes]], is joined by a much larger group of animals, the [[protostome]]s, to meet the ancestor of almost all organisms in the kingdom [[Animalia]], a worm. Just a single class in the joining sub-kingdom of protostomia, the [[Insect]]a, represents three quarter of all animal species on Earth. The great divide between protostomes (meaning 'mouth first') and deuterostomes (meaning 'mouth second') was devised by [[embryology|comparative embryologist]]s based on the way animal embryos diverge after [[gastrulation]] where the [[blastula]] (a hollow ball of cells) indents to form a cup. In the sub-kingdom of protostomia, the indentation eventually becomes the mouth. In deuterostomia which includes humans, the indentation eventually becomes the anus; the mouth is formed later. An extremely large variety of animal phyla constitute protostomia, including [[annelida|annelid worms]] (e.g. garden [[earthworm]]s), [[flatworm]]s (e.g. [[tapeworm]]s and [[fluke]]s), [[mollusc]]s (e.g. [[snail]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[ammonite]]s and [[octopus]]es), and [[arthropod]]s (e.g. [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[spider]]s and [[centipede]]s). Unlike the [[species]], [[class (biology)|classes]] and [[genus|genera]] of animals from the pilgrimage prior to this rendezvous point, joining animals from different [[phylum|phyla]] have no obvious relationship to one another based on traditional [[anatomy]]. But modern [[molecular rangefinding]] has allowed [[Molecular taxonomy|molecular taxonomist]]s to organize all phyla in the pilgrimage into a hierarchy, with the worm as the concestor of all animals in [[Bilateria]] who are bilaterally symmetrical, with left and right side, a dorsal and a ventral side, and a head and a tail end.

In what Dawkins calls the &quot;Great Historic Rendezvous&quot;, he describes the significantly important event of [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]], which results in the beginnings of eukaryotic cells.  In his estimates, this occurred in two or three steps, roughly two billion years ago.  Firstly, bacteria, perhaps related to ''[[Rickettsia]]'', entered proto-protozoan cells. For one reason or another, the bacteria were not digested and did not kill the cell. The cell offered protection to the bacteria, and the bacteria provided energy to the cell, resulting in a [[mutualism|mutualistic]] [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]. This is the speculated origin of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Subsequently, photosynthetic bacteria (thought to be related to [[cyanobacteria]]) entered some, but not all, of these mitochondria-containing cells. These ancient bacteria evolved to become [[chloroplast]]s, and the cells became the [[Plant]] and [[Algae|Algal]] lineages. Meanwhile, the cells which this second endosymbiotic relationship did not occur in went on to form the Kingdoms [[Fungus|Fungi]] and [[Animal|Animalia]], as well as various [[Protozoa]].

Chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own [[genome]]s, and they replicate independent of the cell in which they live. Dawkins acknowledges how the endosymbiotic theory proposed by [[Lynn Margulis]] is now virtually universally accepted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Emergent evolution''' is the [[hypothesis]] that, in the course of [[evolution]], some entirely new properties, such as [[life]] and [[consciousness]], appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The concept has influenced the development of [[systems theory]] and [[complexity theory]]. 

==Historical context==
The word ''[[emergence|emergent]]'' was first used to describe the concept by [[George Lewes]] in volume two of his 1875 book ''Problems of Life and Mind'' (p. 412).  [[Henri Bergson]] covered similar themes in the popular book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' in 1907.  It was further developed by [[Samuel Alexander]] in his [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] during 1916–18 and published as ''Space, Time, and Deity'' (1920).  The term ''emergent evolution'' was coined by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and published as ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923). In an appendix to one lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of [[Roy Wood Sellars]]' ''Evolutionary Naturalism'' (1922).

'''Speciation''' is the [[evolution]]ary process by which new biological [[species]] arise. The biologist [[Orator F. Cook]] seems to have been the first to coin the term 'speciation' for the splitting of lineages or '[[cladogenesis]],' as opposed to '[[anagenesis]]' or 'phyletic evolution' occurring within lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, O. F. 1906. Factors of species-formation. Science 23:506-507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, O. F. 1908. Evolution without isolation. American Naturalist 42:727-731.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether speciation is achieved normally via [[genetic drift]] or [[natural selection]] is the subject of much ongoing discussion. There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are geographically isolated from one another:  [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[peripatric speciation|peripatric]], [[parapatric speciation|parapatric]], and [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]].  Speciation may also be induced artificially, through [[animal husbandry]] or laboratory experiments. Observed examples of each kind of speciation are provided throughout.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html Observed Instances of Speciation]'' by Joseph Boxhorn. Retrieved 28 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural speciation ==

All forms of natural speciation have taken place over the course of evolution, though it still remains a subject of debate as to the relative importance of each mechanism in driving biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive speciation: The role of natural selection in mechanisms of geographic and non-geographic speciation|author=J.M. Baker|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=36|year=2005|pages=303–326  | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.03.005}} [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.03.005 available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The three-spined stickleback (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
One example of natural speciation is the diversity of the [[three-spined stickleback]], a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] fish which, after the last ice age, has undergone speciation into new [[freshwater]] colonies in isolated lakes and streams.  Over an estimated 10,000 generations, the sticklebacks show structural differences that are greater than those seen between different genera of fish including variations in fins, changes in the number or size of their bony plates, variable jaw structure, and color differences.&lt;ref name=sciamstickleback&gt;Kingsley, D.M. (January 2009) &quot;From Atoms to Traits,&quot; ''Scientific American,'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the rate at which speciation events occur over geologic time.  While some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant over time, some [[palaeontologist]]s such as [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time, and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief intervals, a view known as ''[[punctuated equilibrium]]''.

===Allopatric===
[[Image:Speciation modes.svg|right|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[peripatric speciation|peripatric]], [[parapatric speciation|parapatric]] and [[sympatric speciation]].]]
{{main|allopatric speciation}}
During allopatric speciation, a population splits into two geographically isolated allopatric populations (for example, by [[habitat fragmentation]] due to geographical change such as [[mountain building]] or social change such as [[emigration]]). The isolated populations then undergo genotypic and/or phenotypic divergence as they (a) become subjected to dissimilar [[selection|selective]] pressures or (b) they independently undergo [[genetic drift]].  When the populations come back into contact, they have evolved such that they are reproductively isolated and are no longer capable of exchanging genes.

;Observed instances

[[Island genetics]], the tendency of small, isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits, has been observed in many circumstances, including [[insular dwarfism]] and the radical changes among certain famous island chains, like [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] and [[Galápagos]], the latter having given rise to the modern expression of evolutionary theory, after being observed by [[Charles Darwin]]. Perhaps the most famous example of allopatric speciation is Darwin's [[Darwin's finches|Galápagos Finches]].

===Peripatric===
{{main|peripatric speciation}}
In peripatric speciation, new species are formed in isolated, small peripheral populations which are prevented from exchanging genes with the main population. It is related to the concept of a [[founder effect]], since small populations often undergo bottlenecks. [[Genetic drift]] is often proposed to play a significant role in peripatric speciation.

;Observed instances:

*Mayr bird fauna
*The Australian bird ''[[Petroica multicolor]]''
*Reproductive isolation occurs in populations of ''[[Drosophila]]'' subject to population bottlenecking

The [[London Underground mosquito]] is a variant of the mosquito ''Culex pipiens'' which entered in the [[London Underground]] in the nineteenth century. Evidence for its speciation include genetic divergence, behavioral differences, and difficulty in mating.&lt;ref&gt; Katharine Byrne and Richard A Nichols (1999) [http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v82/n1/full/6884120a.html &quot;Culex pipiens in London Underground tunnels: differentiation between surface and subterranean populations&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parapatric===
{{main|parapatric speciation}}
In parapatric speciation, the zones of two diverging populations are separate but do overlap. There is only partial separation afforded by geography, so individuals of each species may come in contact or cross the barrier from time to time, but reduced fitness of the [[Zygosity|heterozygote]] leads to selection for behaviours or mechanisms which prevent [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]] between the two species.

Ecologists refer to parapatric and peripatric speciation in terms of ecological niches.  A [[ecological niche|niche]] must be available in order for a new species to be successful.

;Observed instances

===Sympatric===
{{Refimprove|date:March, 2008|date=March 2008}}
{{main|sympatric speciation}}
In sympatric speciation, species diverge while inhabiting the same place.  Often cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects which become dependent on different [[Host (biology)|host]] plants in the same area. However, the existence of sympatric speciation as a mechanism of speciation is still hotly contested. People have argued that the evidences of sympatric speciation are in fact examples of micro-allopatric, or [[heteropatric speciation]]. The most widely accepted example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of Lake Nabugabo in East Africa, which is thought to be due to '''sexual selection'''.
Sympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location.

Until recently, there has a been a dearth of hard evidence that supports this form of speciation, with a general feeling that interbreeding would soon eliminate any genetic differences that might appear. But there has been at least one recent study that suggests that sympatric speciation has occurred in Tennessee cave salamanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Recent divergence with gene flow in Tennessee cave salamanders (Plethodontidae: Gyrinophilus) inferred from gene genealogies |author= MATTHEW L. NIEMILLER, BENJAMIN M. FITZPATRICK, BRIAN T. MILLER |journal= Molecular Ecology |volume=17 (9)|year=2008|pages=2258–2275  }} [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03750.x  available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-spined sticklebacks, freshwater fishes, that have been studied by Dolph Schluter (who received his Ph.D. for his work on Darwin's finches with Peter Grant) and his current colleagues in British Columbia, provide an intriguing example that is best explained by sympatric speciation.
They have found:

* Two different species of three-spined sticklebacks in each of five different lakes.
** a large benthic species with a large mouth that feeds on large prey in the littoral zone
** a smaller limnetic species — with a smaller mouth — that feeds on the small plankton in open water. 
* DNA analysis indicates that each lake was colonized independently, presumably by a marine ancestor, after the last ice age.
* DNA analysis also shows that the two species in each lake are more closely related to each other than they are to any of the species in the other lakes.
* Nevertheless, the two species in each lake are reproductively isolated; neither mates with the other.
* However, aquarium tests showed that
** the benthic species from one lake will spawn with the benthic species from the other lakes and
** likewise the limnetic species from the different lakes will spawn with each other.
** These benthic and limnetic species even display their mating preferences when presented with sticklebacks from Japanese lakes; that is, a Canadian benthic prefers a Japanese benthic over its close limnetic cousin from its own lake. 
* Their conclusion: in each lake, what began as a single population faced such competition for limited resources that
** disruptive selection — competition favoring fishes at either extreme of body size and mouth size over those nearer the mean — coupled with
** assortative mating — each size preferred mates like it - favored a divergence into two subpopulations exploiting different food in different parts of the lake.
** The fact that this pattern of speciation occurred the same way on three separate occasions suggests strongly that ecological factors in a sympatric population can cause speciation. 

Sympatric speciation driven by ecological factors may also account for the extraordinary diversity of crustaceans living in the depths of Siberia's Lake Baikal. 
====''Speciation via polyploidization''====
[[Image:Polyploidization.svg|right|frame|Speciation via [[polyploidy]]: A [[diploid]] cell undergoes failed [[meiosis]], producing diploid [[gamete]]s, which self-fertilize to produce a tetraploid [[zygote]].]]
[[Polyploidy]] is a mechanism often attributed to causing some speciation events in [[sympatry]]. Not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants, so an increase in [[chromosome]] number may not result in the complete cessation of [[gene]] flow between the incipient polyploids and their parental diploids (see also [[hybrid speciation]]).

Polyploidy is observed in many species of both plants and animals. In fact, it has been proposed that all of the existing plants and most of the animals are polyploids or have undergone an event of polyploidization in their evolutionary history. However, reproduction is often by parthenogenesis since polyploid animals are often sterile. Rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death.

====''Speciation via hybrid formation''====
See [[Speciation#Genetics|Hybrid speciation section under the Genetics heading]] below.

=== Reinforcement (Wallace effect) ===

Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection increases [[reproductive isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, M. (2003) &quot;Speciation - What is the role of reinforcement in speciation?&quot; adapted from ''Evolution'' 3rd edition (Boston: Blackwell Science) [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/tutorials/Speciation15.asp tutorial online]&lt;/ref&gt; It may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact. If their reproductive isolation was complete, then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species.  If their reproductive isolation is incomplete, then further mating between the populations will produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, which may or may not be fertile.  If the hybrids are infertile, or fertile but less fit than their ancestors, then there will be no further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred (e.g., as in [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s.)  The reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments, the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both, therefore would not fit either ecological [[niche]] as well as the parents did. The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor [[assortative mating]], which would control hybridization. This is sometimes called the [[Wallace effect]] after the evolutionary biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ollerton|first=J|title=Flowering time and the Wallace Effect|url=http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|publisher=Heredity, August 2005|accessdate=2007-05-22|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors, then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact.

Reinforcement is required for both parapatric and sympatric speciation. Without reinforcement, the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species, called their &quot;hybrid zone,&quot; will not develop into a boundary between the different species. Hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed.  Hybrid offspring are very common in these regions, which are usually created by diverged species coming into secondary contact. Without reinforcement the two species would have uncontrollable inbreeding.  Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described below.

==Artificial speciation==
New species have been created by domesticated [[animal husbandry]], but the initial dates and methods of the initiation of such species are not clear. For example, [[domestic sheep]] were created by hybridisation, and no longer produce viable offspring with [[mouflon|''Ovis orientalis'']], one species from which they are descended.&lt;ref&gt;Hiendleder S., ''et al.'' (2002) &quot;Molecular analysis of wild and domestic sheep questions current nomenclature and provides evidence for domestication from two different subspecies&quot; ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'' '''269''':893-904&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic [[cattle]], on the other hand, can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild [[ox]], [[gaur]], [[yak]], etc., as they readily produce fertile offspring with them.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, R. (1999) ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' 6th ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]],'' using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies which came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rice, W.R. and G.W. Salt|title=Speciation via disruptive selection on habitat preference: experimental evidence|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=131|year=1988|pages=911–917 | doi = 10.1086/284831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laboratory experiments on speciation: What have we learned in forty years?|author=W.R. Rice and E.E. Hostert|journal=Evolution|volume=47|year=1993|pages=1637–1653 | doi = 10.2307/2410209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diane Dodd was also able to show how mating preferences can develop from [[reproductive isolation]] in ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'' fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types, starch and maltose.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, D.M.B. (1989) &quot;Reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptive divergence in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura''.&quot; ''Evolution'' '''43''':1308–1311.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Drosophila speciation experiment.svg]]

Dodd's experiment has been easy for many others to replicate, including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, M. and V. Ravigné (2002) &quot;Speciation by Natural and Sexual Selection: Models and Experiments&quot; ''The American Naturalist'' '''159''':S22–S35 [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?doi=10.1086/338370 DOI]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
Few speciation genes have been found. They usually involve the reinforcement process of late stages of speciation. In 2008 a speciation gene causing reproductive isolation was reported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/323/5912/376&lt;/ref&gt; It causes hybrid sterility between related subspecies.

=== Hybrid speciation ===
{{main|Hybrid speciation}}
Hybridization between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct [[phenotype]]. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such [[natural selection]] may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if [[reproductive isolation]] is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid speciation is considered an extremely rare event. The [[Mariana Mallard]] arose from hybrid speciation.

Hybridization without change in [[chromosome]] number is called homoploid hybrid speciation. It is considered very rare but has been shown in ''[[Heliconius]]'' [[butterfly|butterflies]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Mavarez2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mavarez | first = J. | coauthors = Salazar, C.A., Bermingham, E., Salcedo, C., Jiggins, C.D. , Linares, M. | year = 2006 | title = Speciation by hybridization in Heliconius butterflies | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/nature04738 | volume = 441 | pages = 868}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sunflower]]s. [[Polyploid]] speciation, which involves changes in chromosome number, is a more common phenomenon, especially in plant species.

=== Gene transposition as a cause ===

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], who studied [[fruit flies]] in the early days of genetic research in 1930s, speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one location to another might cause a species to split into two different species. He mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate themselves in a [[genome]]. Those mobile sections can cause sterility in inter-species [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which can act as a speciation pressure. In theory, his idea was sound, but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature. Eventually a competing theory involving the gradual accumulation of mutations was shown to occur in nature so often that geneticists largely dismissed the moving gene hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=2603 University of Rochester Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, 2006 research shows that jumping of a gene from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Masly, John P., Corbin D. Jones, Mohamed A. F. Noor, John Locke, and H. Allen Orr | month = September | year = 2006 | title = Gene Transposition as a Cause of Hybrid Sterility in Drosophila |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 313 | issue = 5792 | pages = 1448–1450 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/313/5792/1448 | accessdate = 2007-03-18 | doi = 10.1126/science.1128721 | pmid = 16960009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This validates the reproductive isolation mechanism, a key component of speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Minkel, J.R. (September 8, 2006) [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&amp;articleID=000A84DB-CA3B-1501-8A3B83414B7F0000 &quot;Wandering Fly Gene Supports New Model of Speciation&quot;] ''Science News''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interspersed repeats ===

{{main|Interspersed repeat}}

[[Interspersed repeat|Interspersed repetitive DNA sequences]] function as [[Reproductive isolation|isolating mechanisms]]. These repeats protect newly evolving [[gene]] sequences from being overwritten by gene conversion, due to the creation of non-homologies between otherwise [[Homologous chromosome|homologous]] DNA sequences. The non-homologies create barriers to [[gene conversion]]. This barrier allows nascent novel genes to evolve without being overwritten by the [[progenitor]]s of these genes. This uncoupling allows the evolution of new genes, both within [[Gene family|gene families]] and also [[allele|allelic]] forms of a gene. The importance is that this allows the splitting of a [[gene pool]] without requiring physical isolation of the organisms harboring those gene sequences.

=== Human speciation ===

Humans have genetic similarities with [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]], suggesting common ancestors. Analysis of genetic drift and recombination using a [[Markov chain|Markov model]] suggests humans and chimpanzees speciated apart 4.1 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Hobolth A, Christensen OF, Mailund T, Schierup MH (2007) [http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030007 &quot;Genomic Relationships and Speciation Times of Human, Chimpanzee, and Gorilla Inferred from a Coalescent Hidden Markov Model.&quot;] ''PLoS Genet'' '''3'''(2): e7 (doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.0030007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the evolution of life''' outlines the major events in the development of [[life]] on the planet [[Earth]] (See [[Organism]]). For a thorough explanatory context, see the [[history of Earth]], and [[geologic time scale]]. The dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence.

In [[biology]], [[evolution]] is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel [[trait (biological)|trait]]s from generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of [[speciation|new species]] and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world. Contemporary species are related to each other through [[common descent]], products of evolution and [[speciation]] over billions of years.

== Basic timeline ==
{{include timeline|life}}
The basic timeline is a [[Age of the Earth|4.5 billion year old Earth]], with (very approximate) dates:
* 3.8 billion years of [[Prokaryote|simple cells]] (prokaryotes),
* 3 billion years of [[photosynthesis]],
* 2 billion years of [[Eukaryote|complex cells]] (eukaryotes),
* 1 billion years of [[Evolution of multicellularity|multicellular life]],
* 600 million years of simple [[animal]]s,
* 570 million years of [[arthropods]] (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans),
* 550 million years of complex animals,
* 500 million years of [[fish]] and proto-amphibians,
* 475 million years of [[land plant]]s,
* 400 million years of [[insect]]s and [[seed]]s,
* 360 million years of [[amphibian]]s, 

* 300 million years of [[reptile]]s,
* 200 million years of [[mammal]]s,
* 150 million years of [[bird]]s,
* 130 million years of [[flower]]s,
* 65 million years since the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|died out]],
* 2.5 million years since the appearance of the genus [[Homo (genus)|Homo]],
* 200,000 years since [[Homo (genus)|humans]] started looking like they do today,
* 25,000 years since  [[Neanderthal]]s died out.

The study of the '''evolution of emotions''' dates back to the 19th century.  The [[theory]] of [[evolution]] and [[natural selection]] has been applied to the study of [[human communication]], mainly by [[Charles Darwin]] in his work, The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).  Charles Darwin researched the expression of [[emotions]] in an effort to support his theory of evolution.  He proposed that much like other [[traits]] found in humans and animals, emotions also evolved and were adapted over time (Hess and Thibault, 2009).  His work looked at not only [[facial expressions]] in both [[humans]] and [[animals]], but attempted to point out parallels between [[behaviors]] in animals and in humans.


== Origins ==

Darwin's original plan was to include his findings about expression of emotions in a chapter of his work, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (Darwin, 1871) but found that he had enough material for a whole book. It was based on [[observations]], both those around him and of people in many parts of the world. One important observation he made was that even in individuals who were born [[blind]], body and facial expressions displayed are similar to those of anyone else. The ideas found in his book on [[universality]] of emotions were intended to go against what Sir [[Charles Bell]] (1844) claimed about human emotions--saying that in humans, [[muscles]] were created to give humans the unique [[ability]] to express emotions (Hess and Thibault, 2009). The main purpose of Darwin's work was to support the theory of evolution by demonstrating that emotions in humans and animals are similar. Most of the [[similarities]] he found were between [[species]] closely [[related]], but he found some similarities between distantly related species as well. He proposed the idea that emotional states are adaptive, and therefore only those able to express certain emotions passed on their [[genes]] (Darwin, 1872).


=== Darwin's Principles ===

In the 1872 work, Darwin proposed three [[principles]]. The first of the three is the &quot;principle of serviceable habits,&quot; which he defined as useful habits reinforced previously, and then inherited by [[offspring]]. An example that Darwin (1872) used is the contracting of [[eyebrows]] (furrowing the brow), which he noted is serviceable to [[prevent]] too much light from coming into the [[eyes]]. He also said that the raising of eyebrows serviceable to increase the field of [[vision]], even with nothing to be seen. He cited examples of people attempting to remember something and raising their brows, as though they could &quot;see&quot; what they were trying to remember.

The second of the principles is that of [[antithesis]]. While some habits are serviceable, Darwin proposed that some actions or habits are carried out merely because they are opposite in nature to a serviceable habit, but are not serviceable themselves. Shrugging of the shoulders is an example Darwin used of antithesis, because it has no service (Darwin, 1872). Shoulder shrugging is a passive expression, and very opposite of a confident or aggressive expression.

The third of the principles is expressive habits, or nervous discharge from the nervous system. This principle proposes that some habits are performed because of a build-up to the [[nervous system]], which causes a [[discharge]] of the [[excitement]]. Examples include foot and finger tapping, as well as vocal expressions and expressions of [[anger]]. Darwin noted that many animals rarely make noises, even when in [[pain]], but under [[extreme]] circumstances they vocalize in response to the pain and [[fear]] (Darwin, 1872).

== Relevant Research ==

[[Paul Ekman]] is most noted in this field for conducting [[research]] involving facial expressions of emotions. His work provided data to back up Darwin's ideas about universality of facial expressions, even across cultures. He conducted research by showing photographs exhibiting basic expressions of emotion to people and asking them to identify what emotion was being expressed.

In one particular study, Ekman and Wallace Friesen, (1971) presented people in a preliterate culture a story exhibiting a certain emotion along with [[photographs]] of specific facial expressions. They were then asked to choose from two or three choices of photographs the correct emotion being expressed in the [[story]]. The photographs had been previously used in studies involving [[Western cultures]], and were correctly guessed most of the time. Their results indicated that certain expressions of emotions are universally associated with emotions, even in instances in which the people had little or no [[exposure]] to Western culture. The only emotions the preliterate people found hard to [[distinguish]] between were fear and [[surprise]] (Ekman and Friesen, 1971).
Ekman (1993) noted that while universal expressions do not necessarily prove Darwin's theory that they evolved, they do provide strong evidence of the possibility. He mentioned the similarities between human expressions and those of other [[primates]], as well as an overall universality of certain expressions to back up Darwin's ideas. The expressions of emotion that Ekman noted as most universal based on research are: anger, fear, [[disgust]], [[sadness]], and [[enjoyment]] (Ekman, 1993).

[[Carroll Izard]], a [[psychologist]] who is known for his work with emotions, discussed gains and losses associated with the evolution of emotions. He noted that in evolution, humans gained the [[capability]] of expressing themselves with [[language]], which contributed greatly to emotional evolution. Not only can humans [[articulate]] and share their emotions, they can use their experiences to foresee and take appropriate action in future experiences. He did, however, raise the question of whether or not humans have lost some of their [[empathy]] for one another, citing things such as murder and crime against one another as destructive (Izard, 2009).

[[Joseph LeDoux]] (1996) focused much of his research on the emotion of fear. He did so by giving the example of becoming fearful of a snake, when the snake is actually a stick. Fear can take two [[routes]] in the [[brain]], and based on his dual route model, it is a direct route, or a much less direct route. In regards to evolution the less direct route is the newer one. With a path moving through the [[neocortex]] and finally to the [[amygdala]], it is a [[process]] that could only happen after the formation of the &quot;new&quot; brain. The faster response ([[thalamus]] to amygdala) may make the difference between [[surviving]] and passing on genes (LeDoux, 1996).

The term was coined by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in April 1860,&lt;ref name=westminster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A32&amp;pageseq=29 |title=ART.

In the late 19th century it came to mean the concept that [[natural selection]] was the sole mechanism of evolution, in contrast to [[Lamarckism]], then around 1900 it was eclipsed by [[Mendelism]] until the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] unified Darwin's and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s ideas.

==Darwinism in the 19th Century==
[[Image:Darwin ape.jpg|thumb|As &quot;Darwinism&quot; became widely accepted in the 1870s, caricatures of [[Charles Darwin]] with an [[ape]] or [[monkey]] body symbolised [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=376-379}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While the term ''Darwinism'' had been used previously to refer to the work of [[Erasmus Darwin]] in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was reviewed by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in the April 1860 issue of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Huxley File § 4 Darwins Bulldog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=The Huxley File § 4 Darwin's Bulldog |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having hailed the book as, &quot;a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of [[liberalism]]&quot; promoting [[naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]] over [[theology]], and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's [[gradualism]] and doubting if it could be proved that [[natural selection]] could form new species,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=105-106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] in explaining planetary motion:
{{quotation|What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phænomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; an immense debt of gratitude...... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's &quot;Researches on Development,&quot; thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.&lt;ref name=westminster/&gt; }} 

&quot;Darwinism&quot; soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches was that summed in the phrase &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; by the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], which was later taken to be emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to  that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]]. What is now called &quot;[[Social Darwinism]]&quot; was, in its day, synonymous with &quot;Darwinism&quot; &amp;mdash; the application of Darwinian principles of &quot;struggle&quot; to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agendas. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that Darwinism implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on &quot;civilized&quot; people it was possible for &quot;inferior&quot; strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the &quot;superior&quot; strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable &amp;mdash; the foundation of [[eugenics]].

In Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term &quot;Darwinism&quot;, and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in [[Germany]], although, like Spencer Haeckel's &quot;Darwinism&quot; had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection at all.

While the reaction against Darwin's ideas is nowadays often thought to have been widespread immediately, in 1886 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called Darwinism without any problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/darwin/transcript.shtml|title=Evolution and Wonder - Understanding Charles Darwin - Speaking of Faith from American Public Media|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term ''Darwinism'' is often used in the [[United States]] by promoters of [[creationism]], notably by leading members of the [[intelligent design movement]] &lt;ref = Jonnson_essay_on_darwinism&gt;{{cite web | last = Johnson | first = Phillip E.| title = What is Darwinism? | url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/wid.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe [[evolution]]. In this usage, the term has connotations of [[atheism]]. For example, in [[Charles Hodge]]'s book ''What Is Darwinism?'', Hodge answers the question posed in the book's title by concluding: &quot;It is Atheism.&quot;&lt;ref = Ropp_essay_on_darwinism&gt;{{cite web | last = Matthew | first = Ropp | title = Charles Hodge and His Objection to Darwinism | url=http://www.theropps.com/papers/Winter1997/CharlesHodge.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref = Hodge_book_online&gt;{{cite web | last = Hodge | first = Charles | title = What is Darwinism? | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19192/19192-8.txt | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref =Hodge_book&gt;{{cite book | last = Hodge | first = Charles | year = 1874 | title = What is Darwinism? | publisher = Scribner, Armstrong, and Company | id = {{OCLC|11489956}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists use the term ''Darwinism'', often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as [[dogma]]tic and inflexible in their [[belief]].&lt;ref name=morrissullivan/&gt; Casting evolution as a doctrine or belief bolsters religiously motivated political arguments to mandate [[Teach the Controversy|equal time]] for the teaching of creationism in public schools.

However, ''Darwinism'' is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish modern evolutionary theories from those first proposed by Darwin, as well as by historians to differentiate it from other evolutionary theories from around the same period. For example, ''Darwinism'' may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of [[natural selection]], in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as [[genetic drift]] and [[gene flow]]. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the [[history of evolutionary thought]] &amp;mdash; particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as [[Lamarckism]] or later ones such as the [[modern synthesis]].

In the United Kingdom the term retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote in his collection of essays ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', published in 2003,  that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.&lt;ref&gt;Sheahen, Laura.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Systems theory''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[science]] and the study of the nature of [[complex system]]s in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]].  More specifically, it is a framework by which one can analyze and/or describe any group of objects that work in concert to produce some result. This could be a single organism, any organization or society, or any electro-mechanical or informational artifact. Systems theory first originated in biology in the 1920s out of the need to explain the interrelatedness of organisms in ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence S. Bale (1995). [http://narberthpa.com/Bale/lsbale_dop/cybernet.htm ''Gregory Bateson, Cybernetics and the Social.Behavioral Sciences'']. Paper published in: ''Cybernetics and Human Knowing:  a Journal of Second Order Cybernetics and Cyber-Semiotics''. Vol. 3 no. 1 1995 pp. 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt; As a technical and general academic area of study it predominantly refers to the science of systems that resulted from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GST), among others, in initiating what became a project of systems research and practice. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:Margaret Mead NYWTS.jpg|190px|thumb|[[Margaret Mead]] was an influential figure in systems theory.]]
Ideas from systems theory have grown with diversified areas, exemplified by the work of [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], ecological systems with [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Fritjof Capra]], [[organizational theory]] and [[management]] with individuals such as [[Peter Senge]], interdisciplinary study with areas like [[Human Resource Development]] from the work of [[Richard A. Swanson]], and insights from educators such as [[Debora Hammond]].  As a transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary and multiperspectival domain, the area brings together principles and concepts from [[ontology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[biology]], and [[engineering]] as well as [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychotherapy]] (within [[family systems therapy]]) and [[economics]] among others. Systems theory thus serves as a bridge for interdisciplinary dialogue between autonomous areas of study as well as within the area of systems science itself.

In this respect, with the possibility of misinterpretations, von Bertalanffy &lt;ref&gt; Bertalanffy (1950: 142)&lt;/ref&gt; believed a general theory of systems &quot;should be an important regulative device in science,&quot; to guard against superficial analogies that &quot;are useless in science and harmful in their practical consequences.&quot;  Others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original theorists. For example, [[Prigogine|Ilya Prigogine]], of [[the Center for Complex Quantum Systems]] at the University of Texas, Austin, has studied [[emergence|emergent properties]], suggesting that they offer [[analogy|analogues]] for [[life|living systems]]. The theories of [[autopoiesis]] of [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Humberto Maturana]] are a further development in this field.  Important names in contemporary systems science include [[Russell Ackoff]], [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[Peter Checkland]], [[Robert L. Flood]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Michael C. Jackson]], and [[Werner Ulrich]], among others.
 
With the modern foundations for a general theory of systems following the World Wars, [[Ervin Laszlo]], in the preface for Bertalanffy's book ''Perspectives on General System Theory'', maintains that the [[translation]] of &quot;general system theory&quot; from German into English has &quot;wrought a certain amount of havoc&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Laszlo 1974&quot;&gt;(Laszlo 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;. The preface explains that the original concept of a general system theory was &quot;''Allgemeine Systemtheorie'' (or ''Lehre'')&quot;, pointing out the fact that &quot;Theorie&quot; (or &quot;Lehre&quot;) just as &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; (translated Scholarship), &quot;has a much broader meaning in German than the closest English words ‘theory’ and ‘science'&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Laszlo 1974&quot;/&gt;.  With these ideas referring to an organized body of knowledge and &quot;any systematically presented set of concepts, whether they are [[empirical]], [[axiomatic]], or [[philosophical]]&quot;, &quot;Lehre&quot; is associated with theory and science in the etymology of general systems, but also does not translate from the German very well; &quot;teaching&quot; is the &quot;closest equivalent&quot;, but &quot;sounds dogmatic and off the mark&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Laszlo 1974&quot;/&gt;.  While many of the root meanings for the idea of a &quot;general systems theory&quot; might have been lost in the translation and many{{Who|date=March 2009}} were led to believe that the systems theorists had articulated nothing but a [[pseudoscience]], systems theory became a [[nomenclature]] that early investigators used to describe the [[interdependence]] of relationships in [[organization]] by defining a new way of thinking about science and scientific paradigms.

A [[system]] from this [[frame of reference]] is composed of regularly interacting or interrelating groups of activities.  For example, in noting the influence in organizational psychology as the field evolved from &quot;an individually oriented [[industrial psychology]] to a systems and developmentally oriented [[organizational psychology]],&quot; it was recognized that organizations are complex social systems; reducing the parts from the whole reduces the overall effectiveness of organizations &lt;ref&gt;(Schein 1980: 4-11)&lt;/ref&gt;.  This is at difference to conventional models that center on individuals, structures, departments and units separate in part from the whole instead of recognizing the interdependence between groups of individuals, structures and processes that enable an organization to function.  Laszlo &lt;ref&gt; Laslo (1972: 14-15)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the new systems view of organized complexity went &quot;one step beyond the Newtonian view of organized simplicity&quot; in reducing the parts from the whole, or in understanding the whole without relation to the parts.  The relationship between organizations and their [[environment (systems)|environments]] became recognized as the foremost source of complexity and interdependence.  In most cases the whole has properties that cannot be known from analysis of the constituent elements in isolation.  [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], who argued - along with the founders of the systems society - that &quot;the benefit of humankind&quot; is the purpose of science, has made significant and far-reaching contributions to the area of systems theory. For the Primer Group at ISSS, Bánáthy defines a perspective that iterates this view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The systems view is a world-view that is based on the discipline of SYSTEM INQUIRY. Central to systems inquiry is the concept of SYSTEM. In the most general sense, system means a configuration of parts connected and joined together by a web of relationships. The Primer group defines system as a family of relationships among the members acting as a whole. Von Bertalanffy defined system as &quot;elements in standing relationship.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;(Banathy 1997: ¶ 22)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar ideas are found in learning theories that developed from the same fundamental concepts, emphasizing that understanding results from knowing concepts both in part and as a whole.  In fact, Bertalanffy’s organismic psychology paralleled the learning theory of [[Jean Piaget]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;GST&quot;&gt;1968, General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, New York: George Braziller, revised edition 1976: ISBN 0-8076-0453-4&lt;/ref&gt; Interdisciplinary perspectives are critical in breaking away from [[industrial age]] models and thinking where history is [[history]] and math is [[math]] segregated from the [[arts]] and [[music]] separate from the [[sciences]] and never the twain shall meet &lt;ref&gt;(see Steiss 1967; Buckley, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;.  The influential contemporary work of [[Peter Senge]] &lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge (2000: 27-49)&lt;/ref&gt; provides detailed discussion of the commonplace critique of educational systems grounded in conventional assumptions about learning, including the problems with fragmented knowledge and lack of holistic learning from the &quot;machine-age thinking&quot; that became a &quot;model of school separated from daily life.&quot;  It is in this way that systems theorists attempted to provide alternatives and an evolved ideation from orthodox theories with individuals such as [[Max Weber]], [[Emile Durkheim]] in sociology and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in [[scientific management]], which were grounded in classical assumptions &lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8; see also Owens 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;. The theorists sought holistic methods by developing systems concepts that could be integrated with different areas.

The contradiction of [[reductionism]] in conventional theory (which has as its subject a single part) is simply an example of changing assumptions. The emphasis with systems theory shifts from parts to the organization of parts, recognizing interactions of the parts are not &quot;static&quot; and constant but &quot;dynamic&quot; processes.  Conventional [[closed system]]s were questioned with the development of [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] perspectives. The shift was from [[absolute]] and universal authoritative principles and knowledge to [[relative]] and [[general]] [[conceptual]] and [[perceptual]] knowledge &lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8)&lt;/ref&gt;, still in the tradition of theorists that sought to provide means in organizing human life.  Meaning, the [[history of ideas]] that preceded were rethought not lost.  Mechanistic thinking was particularly critiqued, especially the industrial-age mechanistic [[metaphor]] of the mind from [[interpretations]] of [[Newtonian mechanics]] by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers and later psychologists that laid the foundations of modern organizational theory and management by the late 19th century &lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994; Flood 1997; Checkland 1999; Laszlo 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Classical science had not been overthrown, but questions arose over core assumptions that historically influenced organized systems, within both social and technical sciences.

Whether considering the first systems of written communication with [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] [[cuneiform]] to [[Maya numerals|Mayan numerals]], or the feats of engineering with the [[Egyptian pyramids]], systems thinking in essence dates back to antiquity.  Differentiated from Western [[rationalist]] traditions of philosophy, C. West Churchman often identified with the [[I Ching]] as a systems approach sharing a frame of reference similar to [[pre-Socratic]] philosophy and [[Heraclitus]] &lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;. Von Bertalanffy traced systems concepts to the philosophy of [[Leibniz|G.W. von Leibniz]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]]'s ''Coincidentia Oppositorum''.  While modern systems are considerably more complicated, today's systems are embedded in history.

Systems theory as an area of study specifically developed following the World Wars from the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[C. West Churchman]] and others in the 1950s, specifically catalyzed by the [[Macy conferences]].  Cognizant of advances in science that questioned classical assumptions in the organizational sciences, Bertalanffy's idea to develop a theory of systems began as early as the interwar period, publishing &quot;An Outline for General Systems Theory&quot; in the ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol 1, No. 2, by 1950.  Where assumptions in Western science from Greek thought with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Newton]]'s ''[[Principia]]'' have historically influenced all areas from the hard to social sciences (see [[David Easton]]'s seminal development of the &quot;[[political system]]&quot; as an analytical construct), the original theorists explored the implications of twentieth century advances in terms of systems.

Subjects like [[complexity]], [[self-organization]], [[connectionism]] and [[adaptive systems]] had already been studied in the 1940s and 1950s.  In fields like cybernetics, researchers like [[Norbert Wiener]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[Heinz von Foerster]] examined complex systems using mathematics.  [[John von Neumann]] discovered [[cellular automata]] and self-reproducing systems, again with only pencil and paper. [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of chaos theory without any [[computer]] at all.  At the same time [[Howard T. Odum]], the radiation ecologist, recognised that the study of general systems required a language that could depict [[energetics]] and [[kinetics]] at any system scale. Odum developed a general systems, or [[Universal language]], based on the circuit language of [[electronics]] to fulfill this role, known as the [[Energy Systems Language]].  Between 1929-1951, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] at the [[University of Chicago]] had undertaken efforts to encourage innovation and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, aided by the [[Ford Foundation]] with the interdisciplinary Division of the Social Sciences established in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2003: 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;.  Numerous scholars had been actively engaged in ideas before ([[Tectology]] of [[Alexander Bogdanov]] published in 1912-1917 is a remarkable example), but in 1937 von Bertalanffy presented the general theory of systems for a conference at the University of Chicago.

The systems view was based on several fundamental ideas. First, all phenomena can be viewed as a web of relationships among elements, or a [[system]]. Second, all systems, whether [[electrical]], [[biological]], or [[social]], have common [[patterns]], [[behaviors]], and [[properties]] that can be understood and used to develop greater insight into the behavior of complex phenomena and to move closer toward a unity of science. System philosophy, methodology and application are complementary to this science &lt;ref name=&quot;Laszlo 1974&quot;/&gt;.  By 1956, the [[Society for General Systems Research]] was established, renamed the International Society for Systems Science in 1988.  The Cold War had its affects upon the research project for systems theory in ways that sorely disappointed many of the seminal theorists.  Some began to recognize theories defined in association with systems theory had deviated from the initial General Systems Theory (GST) view&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1970&lt;/ref&gt;.  The economist [[Kenneth Boulding]], an early researcher in systems theory, had concerns over the manipulation of systems concepts.  Boulding concluded from the effects of the Cold War that abuses of [[Political power|power]] always prove consequential and that systems theory might  address such issues &lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 229-233)&lt;/ref&gt;.  Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a renewed interest in systems theory with efforts to strengthen an [[ethical]] view.

==Developments in system theories==
=== General systems research and systems inquiry ===
Many early systems theorists aimed at finding a general systems theory that could explain all systems in all fields of science. The term goes back to Bertalanffy's book titled &quot;''General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications''&quot; from 1968&lt;ref name=&quot;GST&quot;&gt;1968, General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, New York: George Braziller, revised edition 1976: ISBN 0-8076-0453-4&lt;/ref&gt;. Von Bertalanffy tells that he developed the &quot;allgemeine Systemtheorie&quot; since 1937 in talks and since 1946 with publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]: ''... aber vom Menschen wissen wir nichts'', (English title: Robots, Men and Minds), translated by Dr. Hans-Joachim Flechtner. page 115. Econ Verlag GmbH (1970), Duesseldorf, Wien. 1st edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Bertalanffy's objective was to bring together under one heading the organismic science that he had observed in his work as a biologist. His desire was to use the word &quot;system&quot; to describe those principles which are common to systems in general. In GST, he writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...there exist models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relationships or &quot;forces&quot; between them. It seems legitimate to ask for a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles applying to systems in general.&lt;ref&gt;(GST p.32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ervin Laszlo &lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.isss.org/perspectives_on_general_system_theory perspectives_on_general_system_theory [ProjectsISSS&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the preface of von Bertalanffy's book ''Perspectives on General System Theory..'' &lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, Ludwig, (1974) ''Perspectives on General System Theory'' Edited by Edgar Taschdjian. George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus when von Bertalanffy spoke of Allgemeine Systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new perspective, a new way of doing science. It was not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on &quot;general system theory&quot;, to wit, that it is a (scientific) &quot;theory of general systems.&quot; To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ludwig von Bertalanffy outlines systems inquiry into three major domains: Philosophy, the Science, and Technology. In his work with the Primer Group, Béla H. Bánáthy generalized the domains into four integratable domains of systemic inquiry: 
#Philosophy, the [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and [[axiology]] of systems; 
#Theory, a set of interrelated concepts and principles applying to all systems; 
#Methodology, the set of models, strategies, methods, and tools that instrumentalize systems theory and philosophy; and 
#Application, the application and interaction of the domains.
These operate in a recursive relationship, he explained. Integrating Philosophy and Theory as Knowledge, and Method and Application as action, Systems Inquiry then is knowledgeable action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.isss.org/Main/SystemsInquiry main_systemsinquiry [ProjectsISSS&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
{{main|Cybernetics}}

The term cybernetics derives from a Greek word which meant a helmsman, and which is the origin of English words such as &quot;govern&quot;.  Cybernetics is the study of [[feedback]] and derived concepts such as [[communication]] and control in living organisms, machines and organisations. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks. 

The terms &quot;systems theory&quot; and &quot;[[cybernetics]]&quot; have been widely used as synonyms. Some authors use the term ''cybernetic'' systems to denote a proper subset of the class of general systems, namely those systems that include [[feedback]] loops. However [[Gordon Pask]]'s differences of eternal interacting actor loops (that produce finite products) makes general systems a proper subset of cybernetics. According to Jackson (2000), von Bertalanffy promoted an embryonic form of general system theory (GST) as early as the 1920s and 1930s but it was not until the early 1950s it became more widely known in scientific circles.

Threads of cybernetics began in the late 1800s that led toward the publishing of seminal works (eg., Wiener's ''Cybernetics'' in 1948 and von Bertalanffy's ''General Systems Theory'' in 1968). Cybernetics arose more from engineering fields and GST from biology. If anything it appears that although the two probably mutually influenced each other, cybernetics had the greater influence. Von Bertalanffy (1969) specifically makes the point of distinguishing between the areas in noting the influence of cybernetics: &quot;Systems theory is frequently identified with cybernetics and control theory. This again is incorrect. Cybernetics as the theory of control mechanisms in technology and nature is founded on the concepts of information and feedback, but as part of a general theory of systems;&quot; then reiterates: &quot;the model is of wide application but should not be identified with 'systems theory' in general&quot;, and that &quot;warning is necessary against its incautious expansion to fields for which its concepts are not made.&quot; (17-23). Jackson (2000) also claims von Bertalanffy was informed by [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s three volume ''[[Tectology]]'' that was published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, and was translated into German in 1928. He also states it is clear to Gorelik (1975) that the &quot;conceptual part&quot; of general system theory (GST) had first been put in place by Bogdanov. The similar position is held by Mattessich (1978) and Capra (1996). Ludwig von Bertalanffy never even mentioned Bogdanov in his works, which Capra (1996) finds &quot;surprising&quot;.

Cybernetics, [[catastrophe theory]], [[chaos theory]] and [[complexity theory]] have the common goal to explain complex systems that consist of a large number of mutually interacting and interrelated parts in terms of those interactions. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), artificial intelligence (AI), and [[artificial life]] (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general (universal) complex (singular) systems. The best context to compare the different &quot;C&quot;-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when [[Edward Lorenz]] accidentally discovered a [[strange attractor]] with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without the use of computers today.

===Complex adaptive systems===
{{main|Complex adaptive systems}}
Complex adaptive systems are special cases of [[complex system]]s.  They are ''complex'' in that they are diverse and made up of multiple interconnected elements and ''adaptive'' in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. The term ''complex adaptive systems'' was coined at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI), by [[John Henry Holland|John H. Holland]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others. However, the approach of the complex adaptive systems does not take account in adoption of information which enables people to use it.  

CAS ideas and models are essentially evolutionary, and they take ground in the modern biological views on adaptation and evolution. Accordingly, the theory of complex adaptive systems bridges developments of the system theory with the ideas of 'generalized [[Darwinism]]', which suggests that Darwinian principles of evolution are capable to explain a range of complex material phenomena, from cosmic to social objects.

==Applications of system theories==
===Living systems theory===
{{main|Living systems theory}}
[[Living systems theory]] is an offshoot of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|von Bertalanffy's]] general systems theory, created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of &quot;life&quot;. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his magnum opus ''Living Systems'', a &quot;living system&quot; must contain each of 20 &quot;critical subsystems&quot;, which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each.

James Grier Miller (1978) wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living systems by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter-energy in physical space-time organized into interacting, interrelated subsystems or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight &quot;nested&quot; hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is &quot;nested&quot; in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

=== Organizational theory ===
[[Image:Kurt Lewin.jpg|125px|right|thumb|[[Kurt Lewin]] attended the [[Macy conferences]] and is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically.]]{{main|Organizational studies}}
The systems framework is also fundamental to [[organizational theory]] as [[organization]]s are complex dynamic goal-oriented processes. One of the early thinkers in the field was [[Alexander Bogdanov]], who developed his [[Tectology]], a theory widely considered a precursor of von Bertalanffy's GST, aiming to model and design human organizations (see Mattessich 1978, Capra 1996). [[Kurt Lewin]] was particularly influential in developing the systems perspective within organizational theory and coined the term &quot;systems of ideology&quot;, from his frustration with behavioral psychologies that became an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology &lt;ref&gt;(see Ash 1992: 198-207)&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Jay Forrester]] with his work in dynamics and management alongside numerous theorists including [[Edgar Schein]] that followed in their tradition since the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Era]] have also been influential.

The systems to organizations relies heavily upon achieving [[entropy|negative entropy]] through [[Open system (systems theory)|openness]] and [[feedback]]. A systemic view on organizations is transdisciplinary and integrative. In other words, it transcends the perspectives of individual disciplines, integrating them on the basis of a common &quot;code&quot;, or more exactly, on the basis of the formal apparatus provided by systems theory. The systems approach gives primacy to the interrelationships, not to the elements of the system. It is from these dynamic interrelationships that new properties of the system emerge. In recent years, ''[[systems thinking]]'' has been developed to provide techniques for studying systems in [[holism|holistic]] ways to supplement traditional [[reductionism|reductionistic]] methods. In this more recent tradition, systems theory in organizational studies is considered by some as a [[humanism|humanistic]] extension of the [[natural science]]s.

===Software and computing===
In the 1960s, systems theory was adopted by the post [[John Von Neumann]] computing and information technology field and, in fact, formed the basis of [[structured analysis]] and [[structured design]] (see also [[Larry Constantine]], [[Tom DeMarco]] and [[Ed Yourdon]]). It was also the basis for early [[software engineering]] and [[computer-aided software engineering]] principles.

By the 1970s, General Systems Theory (GST) was the fundamental underpinning of most commercial software design techniques, and by the 1980, [[Vaughn Frick|W. Vaughn Frick]] and [[Albert F. Case, Jr.]] had used GST to design the &quot;missing link&quot; transformation from system analysis (defining what's needed in a system) to system design (what's actually implemented) using the Yourdon/DeMarco notation. These principles were incorporated into computer-aided software engineering tools delivered by Nastec Corporation, Transform Logic, Inc., KnowledgeWare (see [[Fran Tarkenton]] and [[James Martin]]), Texas Instruments, Arthur Andersen and ultimately IBM Corporation.

===Sociology and Sociocybernetics===
{{main|Sociology}}
Systems theory has also been developed within [[sociology]].  An important figure in the sociological systems perspective as developed from GST is [[Walter F. Buckley|Walter Buckley]] (who from Bertalanffy's theory). [[Niklas Luhmann]] (see Luhmann 1994) is also predominant in the literatures for sociology and systems theory.  Miller's [[living systems theory]] was particularly influential in sociology from the time of the early systems movement.  Models for dynamic equilibrium in systems analysis that contrasted classical views from [[Talcott Parsons]] and George Homas were influential in integrating concepts with the general movement.  With the renewed interest in systems theory on the rise since the 1990s, Bailey (1994) notes the concept of systems in sociology dates back to [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century, [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]], and that sociology was readying into its centennial as the new systems theory was emerging following the World Wars.  To explore the current inroads of systems theory into sociology (primarily in the form of complexity science) see [[sociology and complexity science]].

In sociology, members of Research Committee 51 of the [[International Sociological Association]] (which focuses on [[sociocybernetics]]), have sought to identify the sociocybernetic feedback loops which, it is argued, primarily control the operation of society. On the basis of research largely conducted in the area of education, Raven (1995) has, for example, argued that it is these sociocybernetic processes which consistently undermine well intentioned public action and are currently heading our species, at an exponentially increasing rate, toward extinction. See [[sustainability]]. He suggests that an understanding of these systems processes will allow us to generate the kind of (non &quot;common-sense&quot;) targeted interventions that are required for things to be otherwise - ie to halt the destruction of the planet.

===System dynamics===
{{main|System dynamics}}
System Dynamics was founded in the late 1950s by [[Jay W. Forrester]] of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] with the establishment of the MIT System Dynamics Group. At that time, he began applying what he had learned about systems during his work in [[electrical engineering]] to everyday kinds of systems.
Determining the exact date of the founding of the field of system dynamics is difficult and involves a certain degree of arbitrariness. Jay W. Forrester joined the faculty of the Sloan School at MIT in 1956, where he then developed what is now System Dynamics. The first published article by Jay W. Forrester in the Harvard Business Review on &quot;Industrial Dynamics&quot;, was published in 1958. The members of the [[System Dynamics Society]] have chosen 1957 to mark the occasion as it is the year in which the work leading to that article, which described the dynamics of a manufacturing supply chain, was done.

As an aspect of systems theory, ''[[system dynamics]]'' is a method for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system &amp;mdash; the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components &amp;mdash; is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are [[chaos theory]] and [[social dynamics]]. It is also claimed that, because there are often properties-of-the-whole which cannot be found among the properties-of-the-elements, in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts. An example is the properties of these letters which when considered together can give rise to meaning which does not exist in the letters by themselves. This further explains the integration of tools, like [[language]], as a more [[parsimonious]] [[Process (science)|process]] in the human application of easiest path [[Adaptation|adaptability]] through interconnected systems. One of the weaknesses of System dynamics is the fact that it does not pay attention much to dynamic causation in interelated entities.

===Systems engineering===
{{main|Systems Engineering}}
[[Systems Engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] approach and means for enabling the realization and deployment of successful [[system]]s. It can be viewed as the application of engineering techniques to the engineering of systems, as well as the application of a systems approach to engineering efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomé | first = Bernhard | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1993 | title = Systems Engineering: Principles and Practice of Computer-based Systems Engineering | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester| isbn = 0-471-93552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems Engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and disposal. Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] |url=http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx|title=What is Systems Engineering|accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems psychology===
{{main|Systems psychology}}
Systems psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It is inspired by systems theory and [[systems thinking]], and based on the theoretical work of [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others. It is an approach in [[psychology]], in which groups and individuals, are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Systems psychology includes the domain of [[engineering psychology]], but in addition is more concerned with societal systems and with the study of motivational, affective, cognitive and group behavior than is engineering psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Bittel and Muriel Albers Bittel (1978), ''Encyclopedia of Professional Management'', McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0070054789, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; In systems psychology characteristics of [[organizational behaviour]] for example individual needs, [[reward]]s, [[expectation]]s, and attributes of the people interacting with the [[systems]] are considered in the process in order to create an effective system.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Behrmann (1984), ''Handbook of Microcomputers in Special Education''. College Hill Press. ISBN 093301435X. Page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Systems psychology includes an illusion of homeostatic systems, although most of the living systems are in a continuous disequilibrium of various degrees.

'''Natural landscapes''' &quot;&quot;are [[landscape]]s beyond cultural influence. &quot;A [[natural]] landscape is one that is unaffected by human activity&quot;,  &quot;SES501 Landscape Ecology and GIS&quot;, Keith Ferdinands, Charles Darwin University, July 2004, (1970)&lt;ref&gt;[http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/units/ses501/concepts/definitions/Natural.html What is a natural landscape?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.
A natural landscape is intact when all living and nonliving elements are free to move and change[http://gis.esri.com/library/userconf/proc02/pap0992/p0992.htm].  The nonliving elements distinguish a natural landscape from a [[wilderness]]. A &quot;wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference&quot;, but a wilderness must contain life.  As implied, a natural [[landscape]] may contain either the liviing or nonliving or both.  The expression natural [[landscape]] was first used by Alexander von Humbolt [http://www.usu.edu/history/faculty/conte/6460/KwaHumboldt.pdf Alexander von Humboldt’s Invention of the Natural Landscape].  A discussion of the transition of a pristine landscape state to a humanized [[landscape]] state which includes the human-modified landscape, the primeval landscape, the ancient landscape, the undisturbed wilderness and the managed landscape can be found in Vale, 2002&lt;ref&gt;Fire, Native Peoples, and the Natural Landscape by geographer Thomas R. Vale,  Chapter 1, PP. 1 - 8, Island Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;.  The natural landscape is a place under the current control of natural forces and free of the control of people for an extended period of time.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For here the natural landscape is eloquent of the interplay of forces that have created it.  It is spread before us like the pages of an open book...&quot;, [[Silent Spring]], By Rachel Carson, 1962
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History of natural landscape ==

No place on earth is unaffected by people and our culture.  However, there is no place on earth which cannot return to natural landscape if abandoned by culture.  People are part of [[biodiversity]], but people exert forces on biodiversity, which destroy the natural landscape. Terms such as semi-natural are used to describe landscapes with both cultural and natural features.  People have altered landscape to such an extent that there are few, if any, places on earth which remain pristine. Being pristine, though, is not a prerequisite for natural landscape designation.  Once abandoned by human influences, the landscape is again under the control of natural processes.

== Examples of cultural forces ==

Cultural forces are those which, either intentionally or unintentionally, influence the landscape &lt;ref&gt;[http://natureandculturebetogether.blogspot.com/2007/11/technology-versus-nature-what-is.html  Nature and Culture Together Blog (2007) Technology vs Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts currently maintained by people whether directly or indirectly.  Examples of cultural disruptions are: fences, roads, trails, species under human management, [[invasive species]] introduced by people, extraction or removal of species and objects, vegetation alteration, alterations of animal populations, [[natural landscaping]], buildings, agricultural areas, pollution, paved areas.  Some areas which might be confused with natural landscape are parks for people, agricultural areas, orchards, maintained views (use of [[aesthetic]] judgments), artificial lakes, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, back yards, and flower beds.

== The conflict between cultural forces and the natural landscape ==

In order for a place to return to the natural landscape, all [[cultural artifacts]] attracting people must be removed.  Natural landscape is the [[equilibrium]] which existed prior to significant human impact.  The time necessary for an area to return to the natural landscape depends upon the environment, and it may be termed the “period of [[neglect]].”  Neglect, in this context, means the absence of any management whatsoever.  Most people can easily recognize a neglected landscape.  Human impact on the natural landscape may result in episodes of extinction of native species, episodes of stalled equilibrium, total species destrucion and even the [[putrification]] of soil and water.

The case for returning land to the natural landscape has been championed by those who recognize the harm resulting from people’s actions on this planet.  It has been opposed by those who wish to groom the natural landscape or simply to demonstrate that the natural landscape has some practical value.

The '''creation–evolution controversy''' (also termed the '''creation vs. evolution debate''' or the '''origins debate''') is a recurring [[theology|theological]] and [[culture wars|cultural-political dispute]] about the origins of [[Age of the Earth|the Earth]], [[human evolution|humanity]], [[origin of life|life]], and [[Big Bang|the universe]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hovind|2006}}, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; between the proponents of [[evolution]], backed by [[scientific consensus]], and those who espouse the validity and/or superiority of literal interpretations of a [[creation myth]]. The dispute particularly involves the field of [[evolutionary biology]], but also the fields of [[geology]], [[palaeontology]], [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also focuses on issues such as the definition of science (and of what constitutes scientific research and [[evidence]]), [[science education]] (and whether the teaching of the scientific consensus view should be 'balanced' by also teaching fringe theories), [[free speech]], [[separation of Church and State]], and theology (particularly how different Christians and Christian denominations interpret the [[Book of Genesis]]).  

Within the [[scientific community]] and [[academia]] the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|2006}}; {{harvnb|NSTA|2007}}; {{harvnb|IAP|2006}}; {{harvnb|AAAS|2006}}; and {{harvnb|Pinholster|2006}}; [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:

=== Controversies in the age of Darwin ===
{{seealso|Reaction to Darwin's theory}}
[[Image:Darwin ape.jpg|right|thumb|A satirical image of [[Charles Darwin]] as an ape from 1871 reflects part of the social controversy over whether humans and apes share a [[human evolution|common lineage]].]]

The creation-evolution controversy originated in Europe and North America in the late eighteenth century when discoveries in [[geology]] led to various theories of an ancient earth, and [[fossil]]s showing past extinctions prompted [[History of evolutionary thought|early ideas of evolution]], notably [[Lamarckism]]. In England these ideas of continuing change were seen as a threat to the fixed social order, and were harshly repressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p= 34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions eased, and in 1844 the controversial ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' popularised [[transmutation of species]]. The scientific establishment dismissed it scornfully and the [[Church of England]] reacted with fury, but many [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Quaker]]s and [[Baptist]]s opposed to the privileges of the [[Established church]] favoured its ideas of God acting through laws. Publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' in 1859 brought scientific credibility to [[evolution]], and made it more respectable.&lt;ref&gt;''See&quot;:&lt;br&gt;

*{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p=321-323, 503-505}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was intense interest in the religious implications of Darwin's book, but the Church of England's attention was largely diverted by theological controversy over [[higher criticism]] set out in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] authors, some of whom expressed support for Darwin, as did many [[nonconformist]]s. The Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] openly supported the idea of God working through evolution. However, many Christians were opposed to the idea and even some of Darwin's close friends and supporters including [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Asa Gray]] could not accept some of his ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot;&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/images_Doser/Publications/evol_dialogue_study_guide.pdf AAAS Evolution Dialogues: Science, Ethics and Religion] study guide (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Huxley]], who strongly promoted Darwin's ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the [[clergy]], coined the term ''[[agnosticism|agnostic]]'' to describe his position that God’s existence is unknowable, and Darwin also took this position,&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; but evolution was also taken up by prominent [[atheism|atheists]] including [[Edward Aveling]] and [[Ludwig Büchner]] and criticised, in the words of one reviewer, as &quot;tantamount to atheism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century [[Roman Catholics]] guided by [[Pope Leo XIII]] accepted human evolution from animal ancestors while affirming that the human soul was directly created by God.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt;

Creationists during this period were largely [[Premillennialism|premillennialists]], whose belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ's]] return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the [[Garden of Eden]] to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or [[cleric]]s rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the [[fossil|fossil record]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot; /&gt; Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually willing either to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or to allow that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=18}}, noting that this applies to published or public skeptics. Many or most Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation, but these views were rarely expressed in books and journals. Exceptions are also noted, such as literal interpretations published by Eleazar Lord (1788-1871) and David Nevins Lord (1792-1880). However, the observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807-1873); [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] (1807-1884); [[John William Dawson]] (1820-1899); Enoch Fitch Burr (1818-1907); George D. Armstrong (1813-1899); [[Charles Hodge]], theologian (1797-1878); [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813-1895); [[Edward Hitchcock]], clergyman and respected Amherst College geologist, (1793-1864); Reverend [[Herbert W. Morris]] (1818-1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?-1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838-1922; [[Alexander Patterson]], Presbyterian evangelist who published ''The Other Side of Evolution Its Effects and Fallacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creationism===
{{main|History of creationism}}
{{seealso|Creation and evolution in public education}}

In the [[United States of America]] Creationism was widely accepted and was considered a foundational truth, but there was no official resistance to evolution by mainline denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; Around the start of the 20th century some [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] who saw it as a natural law expressing God’s will. However, development of the [[eugenics]] movement led many Catholics to reject evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; In this enterprise they received little aid from conservative Christians in Britain and Europe. In Britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant, less militant theological tradition. The main British Creationist movement in this period was the [[Evolution Protest Movement]], formed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p161&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Butler Act and the Scopes monkey trial====
{{main|Scopes Trial}}
[[Image:Scopes trial.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Clarence Darrow]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]] chat in court during the [[Scopes trial]].]]

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy]] brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of [[William Jennings Bryan]] several [[U.S. state|state]]s introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution.  By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and passed in some states, such as Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Similar legislation was passed in two other states prior to the Scopes trial, in Oklahoma and Florida. The efforts to enact &quot;Butler Acts&quot; in other jurisdictions were abandoned after the Scopes trial. See [http://www.historynet.com/scopes-trial.htm HistoryNet] (describing the Florida and Oklahoma acts and
[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=50-years-ago-scope-trial-witness&amp;offset=6 Scientific American Article].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws.  [[John T. Scopes]] accepted, and he confessed to teaching his [[Tennessee]] class evolution in defiance of the [[Butler Act]].  The textbook in question was ''Hunter's Civic Biology'' (1914). The trial was widely publicized by [[H. L. Mencken]] among others, and is commonly referred to as the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Scopes was convicted; however, the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution. When the case was appealed to the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the minimum $100 fine instead of allowing the jury to assess the fine).&lt;ref&gt;The statute required a minimum fine of $100, and the state Constitution required all fines over $50 to be assessed by a jury. [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/statcase.htm Court's opinion].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his closing argument, Darrow told the jury that they essentially had no choice but to convict Scopes on the evidence, and he did not hold that against them. The jury was out for a total of nine minutes (including time for egress and ingress). The jury informed the Court that they &quot;passed&quot; the question of the sentence to the Court, a move which the judge accepted despite the Constitutional provision establishing a $50 limit on judge-imposed fines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the law was not in violation of the Religious Preference provisions of the [[Tennessee Constitution]] (section 3 of article 1), which stated that &quot;that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] was not, at the time of the ''Scopes'' decision in the 1920s, deemed applicable to the states. Thus, Scopes' constitutional defense on establishment grounds rested solely on the state constitution. ''See'' [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/statcase.htm Court's opinion]. ''See generally'' [[Incorporation doctrine]] and ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (seminal U.S. Supreme Court opinion finally applying the Establishment Clause against states in 1947). See also [http://volokh.com/posts/1122414938.shtml Book Review] of Professor Larson's Pulitzer Prize winning [[Summer for the Gods]] at point 4 (&quot;The constitutional case was largely based on state constitutional law; this was before most of the Bill of Rights had been incorporated and applied to the states.&quot;); [[Cantwell v. Connecticut]] (1940 Supreme Court case stating that the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment]] is incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and is therefore applicable against the states); {{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of religious freedom| first = Catharine | last = Cookson| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | date = 2003 | pages = 132 et seq. |isbn = 0415941814}}(explaining incorporation doctrine relative to First Amendment); [http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-7-4-b.html Incorporation Doctrine Explained] by Constitutional Rights Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court, applying that state Constitutional language, held
{{quote|We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory....Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity amoung the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.

...Furthermore, [the Butler Act] ''requires'' the teaching of nothing. It only ''forbids'' the teaching of evolution of man from a lower order of animals....As the law thus stands, while the theory of evolution of man may not be taught in the schools of the State, nothing contrary to that theory [such as Creationism] is required to be taught.&lt;ref name=Est&gt;The Court accordingly did not address the question of whether the teaching of Creationism in the public schools was unconstitutional.&lt;/ref&gt;

...It is not necessary now to determine the exact scope of the Religious Preference clause of the Constitution&lt;ref name=Est/&gt; ... Section 3 of article 1 is binding alike on the Legislature and the school authorities. So far we are clear that the Legislature has not crossed these constitutional limitations. |''Scopes v. State'',  289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927).}}

The interpretation of the [[Establishment clause]] up to that time was that the government could not establish a particular religion as the [[state religion|''State'' religion]].  The Tennessee Supreme Court's decision held in effect that the Butler Act was constitutional under the state Constitution's Religious Preference Clause, because the Act did not establish one religion as the &quot;State religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Court stated in its opinion that &quot;England and Scotland maintained State churches as did some of the Colonies, and it was intended by this clause of the Constitution [the Religious Preference Clause] to prevent any such undertaking in Tennessee.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;

====Epperson v. Arkansas====
{{main|Epperson v. Arkansas}}

In 1968, the [[United States Supreme Court]] invalidated a forty year old [[Arkansas]] statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the public schools.  A [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] high school biology teacher, Susan Epperson, filed suit charging the law violated the federal [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the Establishment Clause.  The Little Rock Ministerial Association supported Epperson's challenge, declaring, &quot;to use the Bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the Book of Genesis, but to do God and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nelkin&quot;/&gt; The Court held that the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, &quot;that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court  |litigants =Epperson et al. v.

==== Daniel v. Waters ====
{{main|Daniel v. Waters}}

Daniel v. Waters was a 1975 legal case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] struck down [[Tennessee]]'s law regarding the teaching of &quot;equal time&quot; of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]] in [[public school]] [[science]] classes because it violated the [[Establishment clause]] of the [[US Constitution]]. Following this ruling, creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed [[creation science]], and several states passed legislative acts requiring that this be given equal time with teaching of evolution.

=== Creation Science ===
{{main|Creation Science}}

As biologists grew more and more confident in evolution as the central defining principle of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=248,250}}, see also {{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; American membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of scripture rose, with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] outpacing all other denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; With growth, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the first major modern creationist book was published: [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|John C. Whitcomb Jr.'s]] ''[[The Genesis Flood]].'' Morris and Whitcomb argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs, and that God created each 'kind' of life individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}},{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=xi,200-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of this, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' Creation Science Research Center (CSRC) rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism, and also published other books such as Kelly Segrave's sensational ''Sons of God Return'' that dealt with [[UFOlogy]], [[flood geology]], and [[demonology]] against Morris' objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284-285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the CSRC broke up
over a divide between sensationalism and a more intellectual approach, and Morris founded the [[Institute for Creation Research]], which was promised to be controlled and operated by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the scientific-sounding terms ''scientific creationism'' and ''creation science''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting {{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255-256}}: &quot;Fundamentalists no longer merely denounced Darwinism as false; they offered a scientific-sounding alternative of their own, which they called either 'scientific creationism (as distinct from religious creationism) or 'creation science' (as opposed to evolution science.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The flood geologists effectively co-opted &quot;the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=254-255}}, {{Harvnb|Numbers|1998|p=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Court cases ====
===== McLean v. Arkansas =====
{{main|McLean v. Arkansas}}

In 1982 another case in [[Arkansas]] ruled that the Arkansas &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act&quot; was unconstitutional because it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. Much of the transcript of the case was lost, including [[evidence (law)|evidence]] from [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]].

===== Edwards v. Aguillard =====
{{main|Edwards v. Aguillard}}

In the early 1980s, the [[Louisiana]] legislature passed a law titled the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction Act&quot;. The act did not require teaching either [[evolution]] or [[creationism]] as such, but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, so-called [[creation science]] had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, arguing that the act was about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state in support of the act. Lower courts ruled that the State's actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of creation science, but the State appealed to the Supreme Court. 

In the similar case of ''McLean v. Arkansas'' (see above) the federal trial court had also decided against creationism. ''Mclean v. Arkansas'' however was not appealed to the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with ''Edwards v. Aguillard''. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the Louisiana act was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, however, it stated in its opinion that &quot;teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction,&quot;  leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that came to be known as [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/1:Introduction#C. Federal Jurisprudential Legal Landscape|Ruling]], [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] pp 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Intelligent design}}
{{seealso|Neo-creationism|Intelligent design movement|Teach the Controversy|Critical Analysis of Evolution|}}

In response to [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], the [[Neo-creationism|Neo-Creationist]] [[intelligent design movement]] was formed around the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]]. Its goal is to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, policy makers, educators, and the scientific community, and makes the claim that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign|title=Top Questions-1.What is the theory of intelligent design?|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been viewed as a &quot;scientific&quot; approach to creationism by creationists, but is widely rejected as unscientific by the science community (see for example, [[list of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]]).

==== Controversy in recent times ====
{{see also|Politics of creationism|Intelligent design in politics}}

The controversy continues to this day, with the [[mainstream]] [[scientific consensus]] on the origins and evolution of life challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually [[young earth creationism]], [[creation science]], [[old earth creationism]] or [[intelligent design]]) as an alternative. Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to [[evangelism|evangelize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verderame|2007}},{{harvnb|Simon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views which cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by many mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewey|1994|p=31}}, and {{Harvnb|Wiker|2003}}, summarizing Gould.&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion in regards to the concepts of evolution, creationism, and intelligent design is fluctuating.

More recently, the [[Intelligent Design movement]] has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists argue that [[Intelligent design]] does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is essentially creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=258}} &quot;Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of creation science; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.&quot; See also {{Harvnb|Martz &amp; McDaniel|1987|Ref=CITEREFMartzMcDaniel1987|p=23}}, a Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Its leading proponent, the [[Discovery Institute]], made widely publicised claims that it was a new science, though the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the [[Sternberg peer review controversy]], with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal's scientific standards, was a &quot;significant departure&quot; from the journal's normal subject area and was published at the former editor's sole discretion, &quot;contrary to typical editorial practices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biolsocwash.org/id_statement.html ''Statement from the Council of the Biological Society of Washington'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[George W.

==== Kansas evolution hearings ====
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}
In the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms, the hub of the [[intelligent design movement]], the [[Discovery Institute]], arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plans. The Kansas Evolution Hearings were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]] 5 May to 12 May 2005. The Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and electioneering on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ Some question group's move with elections nearing] 6News Lawrence, Lawrence Journal-World. 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2006, 4 of the 6 conservative Republicans who approved the [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14137751/ Evolution’s foes lose ground in Kansas] MSNBC, 2 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 February 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of [[science]] was once again limited to &quot;the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Kansas-Evolution-History.php Evolution of Kansas science standards continues as Darwin's theories regain prominence] The Associated Press, via the International Herald Tribune, 13 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Dover Trial ====
{{main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}

Following the [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in which the Court held that a [[Louisiana]] law requiring that [[creation science]] be taught in public schools whenever [[evolution]] was taught was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion, creationists renewed their efforts to introduce creationism into public school science classes. This effort resulted in [[intelligent design]], which sought to avoid legal prohibitions by leaving the source of creation an unnamed and undefined [[intelligent designer]], as opposed to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=20418&amp;print=yes&amp;units=all The &quot;Evolution&quot; of Creationism] Timeline: how creationism has &quot;evolved&quot;. [[People for the American Way]].&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately resulted in the &quot;Dover Trial,&quot; ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', which went to trial on 26 September 2005 and was decided on 20 December 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught in public school science classrooms was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139 page [[:s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|opinion of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'']] held that intelligent design was not a subject of legitimate scientific research, and that it &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and hence religious, antecedents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

== Viewpoints ==
=== Young Earth creationism ===
{{main|Young Earth creationism}}
{{seealso|Creation science|Flood geology}}

Young Earth creationism is the belief that the Earth was created by [[God]] within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis]], within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Young Earth creationists often believe that the [[Universe]] has a similar age as the Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] are attempts by some creationist thinkers to give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth timeframes. This belief generally has a basis in a [[Biblical literalism|literal]] and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] interpretation of the Bible.

=== Old Earth creationism ===
{{main|Old Earth creationism}}

{{seealso|Gap creationism|Day-Age Creationism|Progressive creationism}}

Old Earth creationism holds that the [[universe|physical universe]] was created by God, but that the creation event of Genesis is not to be taken strictly literally. This group generally believes that the [[age of the Universe]] and the [[age of the Earth]] are as described by [[astronomers]] and [[geologists]], but that details of the [[evolutionary theory]] are questionable. Old Earth creationists interpret the [[Creation according to Genesis|creation accounts of Genesis]] in a number of ways, that each differ from the six, consecutive, 24-hour day creation of the [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] Young Earth Creationist view.

=== Neo-Creationism ===
{{main|Neo-Creationism}}
{{seealso|Intelligent design}}

Neo-Creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. Their goal is to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, education policy makers and the [[scientific community]]. It aims to re-frame the debate over the [[origin of life|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public. Neo-creationists may be either Young Earth or Old Earth Creationists, and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints (e.g. on the interpretation of the Bible). Neo-Creationism currently exists in the form of the [[intelligent design movement]], which has a [[intelligent design movement#The 'big tent' strategy|'big tent' strategy]] making it inclusive of many Young Earth Creationists (such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] and [[Percival Davis]]).

=== Theistic evolution ===
{{main|Theistic evolution}}
{{seealso|Naturalism (philosophy)|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Clergy Letter Project}}

Theistic evolution is the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of modern [[scientific theory]], including, specifically, [[evolution]]. It generally views evolution as a tool used by a creator god, who is both the [[first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the [[day-age creationism|day-age]] interpretation of the [[creation according to Genesis|Genesis creation account]]; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a &quot;literal&quot; description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or [[allegory]].

This position does not generally exclude the viewpoint of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]], a long standing convention of the [[scientific method]] in [[science]].

Theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism (including intelligent design). Notable examples have been biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and theologian [[John Haught]] (both [[Catholics]]), who testified for the plaintiffs in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]. Another example is the [[Clergy Letter Project]], an organization that has created and maintains a statement signed by American Christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism, with specific reference to points raised by intelligent design proponents. Theistic evolutionists have also been active in Citizens Alliances for Science that oppose the introduction of creationism into public school science classes (one example being evangelical Christian geologist [[Keith B. Miller]], who is a prominent board member of [[Kansas Citizens for Science]]).

=== Naturalistic evolution ===
{{seealso|Metaphysical naturalism}}

Naturalistic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution and of [[metaphysical naturalism]] (and thus rejection of [[theism]] and [[theistic evolution]]).

== Arguments relating to the definition and limits of science ==

Critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], [[Occam's Razor]] or [[parsimony]], and the [[Copernican principle]] are claimed to be the result of a [[bias]] within science toward [[philosophical naturalism]], which is equated by many [[creationists]] with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}, {{harvnb|Hodge|1874|p=177}}, {{harvnb|Wiker|2003}}, {{harvnb|Peters &amp; Hewlett|2005|Ref=CITEREFPetersHewlett2005|p=5}}--Peters and Hewlett argue that the atheism of many evolutionary supporters must be removed from the debate&lt;/ref&gt; In countering this claim, [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] use the term [[Naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] to refer to the long standing convention in science of the [[scientific method]]. The [[methodology|methodological]] assumption is that [[observation|observable]] events in [[nature]] are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the [[supernatural]], and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenski|2000|p=Conclusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because modern science tries to rely on the minimization of [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] assumptions, error, and [[subjectivity]], as well as on avoidance of [[Francis Bacon|Baconian idols]], it remains neutral on subjective subjects such as [[religion]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1930|p=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream proponents accuse the creationists of conflating the two in a form of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory vs. fact ===

{{main|Evolution as theory and fact}}

The argument that evolution is a [[theory]], not a fact, has often been made against the exclusive teaching of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1993|p=63}}, {{Harvnb|Tolson|2005}}, {{harvnb|Moran|1993}} ; [http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/cobb%20county%20decision.pdf ''Selman v. Cobb County School District]''. US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (2005); Talk. Origins; Bill Moyers ''et al.'', 2004. &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins ''Now'' with Bill Moyers].&quot; PBS. Accessed 2006-01-29. Interview with Richard Dawkins&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of &quot;theory&quot; that is used by scientists. In common usage, &quot;theory&quot; often refers to conjectures, hypotheses, and unproven assumptions. However, in science, &quot;theory&quot; usually means &quot;a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster online dictionary. www.m-w.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring this issue, [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Evolution]] is a theory. It is also a fact. And [[fact]]s and [[theories]] are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. [[Theories]] are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of [[gravitation]] replaced Newton's, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.}}

=== Falsifiability ===

[[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper|Karl R. Popper]] set out the concept of [[falsifiability]] as a way to distinguish science and pseudoscience: Testable theories are scientific, but those that are untestable are not.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;
*{{harvnb|Number|1992|p=247}};
*Wilkins, John S, [http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html Evolution and Philosophy: Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean?], [[TalkOrigins Archive]]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Unended Quest'', Popper declared &quot;I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[research]] [[Program (management)|programme]]'', a possible framework for testable scientific theories,&quot; while pointing out it had &quot;scientific character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1976|p=168 and 172}} quoted in {{harvnb|Kofahl|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what one sociologist derisively called &quot;Popper-chopping,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Unknown sociologist quoted in {{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; opponents of evolution seized upon Popper's definition to claim [[evolution]] was not a science, and claimed creationism was an equally valid metaphysical research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kofahl|1989}} as quoted by {{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Duane Gish]], a leading Creationist proponent, wrote in a letter to Discover magazine (July 1981): &quot;[[Stephen Jay Gould]] states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory. While many Creationists claim creation is a scientific theory other Creationists have stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is equally religious).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewin|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Popper responded to news that his conclusions were being used by anti-evolutionary forces by affirming that evolutionary theories regarding the origins of life on earth were [[science|scientific]] because &quot;their hypotheses can in many cases be tested.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p274&lt;/ref&gt; However, creationists claimed that a key evolutionary concept, that all life on Earth is descended from a single common ancestor, was not mentioned as testable by Popper, and claimed it never would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kofahl|1981|p=873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of the value of Darwin's theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/indexcc/CA/CA211_1.html Talkorigins summary of Karl Popper attitudes towards evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years later, Popper changed his mind, and later wrote, &quot;''I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;
*''Natural selection and the emergence of mind'', Karl Popper, Dialectica 32(3/4): 339—355, 1978
*[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_5_28/ai_n6194235/pg_1 ''Did Popper refute evolution?''], Massimo Pigliucci, [[Skeptical Inquirer]], Sept-Oct 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate among some scientists and philosophers of science on the applicability of falsifiability in science continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruse|1999|p=13-37}}, which discusses conflicting ideas about science among [[Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]], and their disciples.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple falsifiability tests for [[common descent]] have been offered by some scientists: For instance, [[biologist]] and prominent critic of creationism [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[J.B.S. Haldane]] both pointed out that if [[fossil]] [[rabbit]]s were found in the [[Precambrian]] [[era (geology)|era]], a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved, &quot;that would completely blow [[evolution]] out of the water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by {{harvnb|Wallis|2005|p=32}}. Also see {{harvnb|Dawkins|1986}} and {{harvnb|Dawkins|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|2005|p=6}} [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] quoting [[J.B.S. Haldane|Haldane]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsifiability has also caused problems for creationists: In his 1982 decision [[McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]], Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William R. Overton]] used falsifiability as one basis for his ruling against the teaching of creation science in the public schools, ultimately declaring it &quot;simply not science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dorman|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflation of science and religion ===

Many of the most vocal creationists blur the boundaries between criticisms of [[modern science]], [[philosophy]], and [[culture]]. They often conjoin their arguments focused on the science of evolution with [[doctrine|doctrinal]] statements or [[Evangelism|evangelistic]] attempts.  This can be a central focus of [[apologetics]]. For example, in explanation for his &quot;struggle&quot; against evolution, prominent creationist [[Ken Ham]] has declared &quot;the [[Lord]] has not just called us to knock down evolution, but to help in restoring the foundation of the [[gospel]] in our society. We believe that if the [[Church body|church]]es took up the tool of [[Approaches to evangelism#Creation evangelism|Creation Evangelism]] in society, not only would we see a stemming of the tide of [[humanism|humanistic philosophy]], but we would also see the seeds of revival sown in a culture which is becoming increasingly more [[paganism|pagan]] each day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v6/i2/creationII.asp Ham, Ken. Creation Evangelism] (Part II of Relevance of Creation). ''Creation Magazine &lt;nowiki&gt;'6'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(2):17, November 1983. &lt;/ref&gt;  Ham teaches that a rejection of the [[Creation according to Genesis|biblical]] creation history undermines the relevancy of the Christian [[gospel]]s and derivatively weakens the [[morality|moral]] foundations of society.

== Disputes relating to science ==

Many [[creationists]] strongly oppose certain [[scientific theories]] in a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of [[bias]] within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1993|p=69}} where Johnson cites three pages spent in Issac Asimov's ''New Guide to Science'' that take creationists to task, while only spending one half page on evidence of [[evolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in [[modern science]], creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on [[faith]], [[creation science]], and/or [[intelligent design]]. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by [[quote mining]]) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].

=== Biology ===
{{PhylomapB|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on rRNA genes.}}

Disputes relating to [[evolutionary biology]] are central to the controversy between Creationists and the [[scientific community]]. The aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include [[common descent]] (and particularly [[human evolution]] from common ancestors with other members of the [[Hominidae|Great Apes]]), [[macroevolution]], and the existence of [[transitional fossil]]s.

==== Common descent ====
{{main|Common descent}}
{{seealso|Evidence of common descent|Tree of life (science)}}

{{quote|[The] Discovery [Institute] presents common descent as controversial exclusively within the animal kingdom, as it focuses on embryology, anatomy, and the fossil record to raise questions about them. In the real world of science, common descent of animals is completely noncontroversial; any controversy resides in the microbial world.

A group of [[organisms]] is said to have common descent if they have a common [[ancestor]]. A theory of universal common descent based on [[evolution]]ary principles was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and is now generally accepted by biologists. The [[last universal common ancestor]], that is, the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.9 billion years ago]].

With a few exceptions (e.g. [[Michael Behe]]), the vast majority of Creationists reject this theory {{Fact|date=September 2008}}. &lt;!-- surely old earth creationists outnumber young earth creationists even if ID adherents do not? --&gt;

[[Evidence of common descent]] includes evidence from [[fossil record]]s, [[comparative anatomy]], [[biogeography|geographical distribution of species]], [[comparative physiology]] and [[comparative biochemistry]].

===== Human evolution =====
{{Wikibooks|Introduction to Paleoanthropology}}
{{main|Human evolution}}
{{seealso|Paleoanthropology|Adam and Eve}}

[[Human evolution]] is the study of the biological evolution of humans as a distinct [[species]] from its common ancestors with other animals.  Analysis of fossil evidence and [[genetic distance]] are two of the means by which scientists understand this evolutionary history.

Fossil evidence suggests that humans' earliest [[ape|hominoid]] ancestors may have split from other [[primates]] as early as the late [[Oligocene]], circa 26-24 [[Megaannum|Ma]], and that by the early [[Miocene]], the [[adaptive radiation]] of many different hominoid forms was well underway.&lt;ref name=&quot;stringer&quot;&gt;{{citation |last2=Andrews |first2=Peter |last=Stringer |first=Chris |title=The complete world of human evolution |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |year=2005 |pages= 240 |isbn=0-500-05132-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence from the [[Molecular clock|molecular dating]] of genetic differences indicates that the [[gibbon]] lineage (family [[Hylobatidae]]) diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the [[orangutan]] lineage (subfamily [[Ponginae]]) diverged about 12 Ma.  While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from India and ''Griphopithecus'' from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the [[gorilla]]s, and then the [[chimpanzee]] (genus ''Pan'') split from the line leading to the humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Relethford |first=John |title=Reflections of our past: how human history is revealed in our genes |publisher=Westview Press |location=Boulder, Colo |year=2003 |pages=257 |isbn=0-8133-3958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively [[hominid]] fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see [[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Toumaï]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/july/toumai/index.html |title=Toumaï the Human Ancestor: Skull of Oldest Known Hominid Unearthed in Chad |publisher=NPR: All Things Considered |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons of chimpanzee and human [[DNA]] show the two are approximately 98.4 percent identical, and are taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;98.4&quot;&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html Chimps are human, gene study implies] New Scientist, website, 19 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Today, only one distinct human species survives, but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record, including ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo habilis]]'', and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''.

Creationists dispute there is evidence of shared ancestry in the fossil evidence, and argue either that these are misassigned ape fossils (e.g. that [[Java man]] was a gibbon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/homs/gibbon.html ''Was Java Man a gibbon?''], Jim Foley, [[TalkOrigins]] website, 30 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;) or too similar to modern humans to designate them as distinct or transitional forms.&lt;ref&gt;See disputes over the classification of Neanderthals in ''The Counter-Creationism Handbook'', Mark Isaak, University of California Press (2007), ISBN 978-0520249264&lt;/ref&gt;  However Creationists frequently disagree where the dividing lines would be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/homs/compare.html ''Comparison of all skulls''], Jim Foley, [[TalkOrigins]] website, 8 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation myth]]s (such as the [[Book of Genesis]]) frequently posit a [[First man or woman|first man]] ([[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], in the case of Genesis) as an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account.

Creationists also dispute science's interpretation of genetic evidence in the study of human evolution.  They argue that it is a &quot;dubious assumption&quot; that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship, and that scientists are coming to this interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist.  Creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelkin&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Nelkin |first=Dorothy |title=The Creation Controversy: Science or Scripture in Schools |publisher=iUniverse |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= 242 |isbn=0-595-00194-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Macroevolution ====
{{main|Macroevolution}}
{{seealso|Speciation}}

Many creationists now accept the possibilities of [[microevolution]] within &quot;kinds&quot; but refuse to accept and have long argued against the possibility of macroevolution. Macroevolution is defined by the scientific community to be [[evolution]] that occurs at or above the level of [[species]]. Under this definition, macroevolution can be considered to be a fact, as evidenced by observed instances of [[speciation]]. Creationists however tend to apply a more restrictive, if vaguer, definition of macroevolution, often relating to the emergence of new body forms or [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]. The scientific community considers that there is strong evidence for even such more restrictive definitions, but the evidence for this is more complex.

Recent arguments against (such restrictive definitions of) macroevolution include the [[intelligent design]] arguments of [[irreducible complexity]] and [[specified complexity]]. However, neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as [[pseudoscience]].

==== Transitional fossils ====
{{main|Transitional fossil}}
{{seealso|List of transitional fossils|Bird evolution|Evolution of the horse}}

It is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Creationism'', [[Henry M. Morris]], 1985, pp. 78-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life--How Did It Get Here?'', [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]], 1985, pp. 57-59&lt;/ref&gt; This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible, however, that a complex feature with one function can adapt a wholly different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been meant for gliding, trapping flying prey, and/or mating display. Nowadays, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight. 

[[Image:Ambulocetus BW.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Reconstruction of ''[[Ambulocetus]] natans'']]

As another example, Alan Haywood stated in ''Creation and Evolution'' that &quot;Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems. They believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Alan (1985) ''Creation and Evolution''.Triangle Books, London. Quoted in ''[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_leviathan.html Hooking Leviathan by Its Past]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[evolution of whales]] has however been documented in considerable detail, with ''[[Ambulocetus]]'', described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian [[crocodile]], as one of the transitional fossils.

Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. However, progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.

The theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory, however, pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period of time. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution.  For example the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime.  60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

=== Geology ===
{{main|Flood Geology}}
{{seealso|Creation geophysics|Geochronology|Age of the Earth}}

Many believers in [[Young Earth Creationism]] – a position held by the majority of proponents of [[Flood Geology]] – accept biblical ''chronogenealogies'' (such as the [[Ussher chronology]] which in turn is based on the [[Masoretic]] version of the [[Genealogies of Genesis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AiG&quot;&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v17/i3/chronogenealogies.asp Biblical chronogenealogies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grisda.org/origins/07053.htm The Meaning of the Chronogenealogies of Genesis 5 and 11]&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that God created the universe approximately 6000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in [[anthropology]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]] that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of [[radiometric dating]] and [[Isochron dating|isochron]] analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by [[diffusion]] of the parent and daughter isotopes. However, a full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.

The consensus of professional scientific organisations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately 4.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf ''IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution''], Interacademy Panel on Global Issues, 21 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology. Apparently inconsistent radiometric dates are often quoted to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method. Mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the [[physical laws]] governing [[radioactive decay]] have not been violated since the sample was formed (harking back to Lyell's doctrine of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]). They also point out that the &quot;problems&quot; that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all, are issues with known contamination, or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data.

=== Other sciences ===
==== Cosmology ====
{{seealso|Age of the universe}}

Whilst [[Young Earth Creationism|Young Earth Creationists]] believe that the [[Universe]] was created approximately 6000 years ago, the current scientific consensus is that it is about 13.7 billion years old. The recent science of [[nucleocosmochronology]] is extending the approaches used for [[Carbon-14]] dating to the dating of astronomical features.  For example based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to have been formed between 8.3 ± 1.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Del2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Del Peloso, E.F. | coauthors = Da Silva, L.; De Mello, G.F.P.; Arany-prado, L.I. | year = 2005 | title = The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology | journal = A&amp;A | volume = 434 | pages = 301–308 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20047060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other creationists, including Old Earth Creationists, do not necessarily dispute these figures.

==== Nuclear physics ====
{{seealso|radiometric dating}}

Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period of time, from which they infer that &quot;billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay&quot; have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that [[Radioactive decay|radioisotope decay]] rates are constant, a core principle underlying [[nuclear physics]] generally, and [[radiometric dating]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=302 ''Nuclear Decay: Evidence For A Young World''], [[Russell Humphreys|D. Russell Humphreys]], Impact, Number 352, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental [[geochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toarchive.org/faqs/helium/zircons.html ''Young-Earth Creationist Helium Diffusion &quot;Dates&quot; Fallacies Based on Bad Assumptions and Questionable Data''], Kevin R. Henke, [[TalkOrigins]] website, Original version: 17 March 2005, Revision: 24 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gondwanaresearch.com/rate.htm ''R.A.T.E: More Faulty Creation Science from The Institute for Creation Research''], J. G. Meert, Gondwana Research, The Official Journal of the International Association for Gondwana, 13 November 2000 (updated 6 February 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In refutation of young-Earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specialising in isotope dating states:
{{quotation|There are only three quite technical instances where a half-life changes, and these do not affect the dating methods [under discussion]&lt;ref&gt;Dating methods discussed were [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]], [[rubidium-strontium dating]], [[samarium-neodymium dating]], lutetium-hafnium, [[rhenium-osmium dating]], and [[uranium-lead dating]].&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;:
#Only one technical exception occurs under terrestrial conditions, and this is not for an isotope used for dating. ... The artificially-produced isotope, beryllium-7 has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.
# ... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus. ... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees. ...
#The last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by atomic clocks in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. No rocks in our solar system are going fast enough to make a noticeable change in their dates. ...|Roger C.

=== Religion and historical scientists ===

Creationists often argue that Christianity and literal belief in the Bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|2005|p=67-114}}, Chapter Five: The Church and Science&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Institute for Creation Research founder [[Henry M. Morris]] has enumerated scientists such as [[Galileo Galilei|astronomer and philosopher Galileo]], mathematician and theoretical physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]], mathematician and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]], geneticist monk [[Gregor Mendel]], and [[Isaac Newton]] as believers in a biblical creation narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument usually involves scientists either who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study didn't include evolution. The argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toarchive.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html Index to Creationist Claims - Claim CA114] edited by Mark Isaak. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis]] combines [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution|Evolution]] with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] theories of inheritance and genetics.&lt;!-- Hopefully something so well known won't be viewed as original research. --&gt; Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|modern synthesis]]. Some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today: [[Louis Pasteur]], for example, opposed the theory of [[spontaneous generation]] with [[biogenesis]], an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on [[chemical evolution]] and [[abiogenesis]]. Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toarchive.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html Index to Creationist Claims - Claim CA114.22] edited by Mark Isaak. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion and science|The relationship between science and religion]] was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late-19th century, and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sci_rel.htm] Science and religion:
Conflicts &amp; occasional agreements&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs. Even so, such professions of faith were not insurance against dogmatic opposition by certain religious people.

Some extensions to this creationist argument have included the incorrect suggestions that [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[deism]] was a tacit endorsement of creationism or that [[Charles Darwin]] [[Elizabeth Hope|converted on his deathbed and recanted evolutionary theory]].

=== Debates ===

Many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life, hosted by a variety of institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,119,Why-I-Wont-Debate-Creationists,Richard-Dawkins ''Why I Won't Debate Creationists''], [[Richard Dawkins]], Reason : In the News, richarddawkins.net, the official Richard Dawkins website, Monday, 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in May 2004 Dr. [[Michael Shermer]] debated creationist [[Kent Hovind]] in front of a predominantly [[creationist]] audience.

Others, like evolutionary biologist [[Massimo Pigliucci]], have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try &quot;to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks&quot; and at Hovind's assertion that biologists believe humans &quot;evolved from bananas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]].

[[Eugenie Scott]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]], a non-profit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hovind&quot; /&gt; Scott says that &quot;Evolution is not on trial in the world of science,&quot; and &quot;the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution&quot; but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took a public stance against appearing to give legitimacy to creationism by debating its proponents. He noted during a [[Caltech]] lecture in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 'Why People Believe Weird Things', Owl Books, 2002. Paperback ed, p. 153. &lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Debate is an art form. It is about the winning of arguments. It is not about the discovery of truth. There are certain rules and procedures to debate that really have nothing to do with establishing fact — which creationists have mastered. Some of those rules are: never say anything positive about your own position because it can be attacked, but chip away at what appear to be the weaknesses in your opponent's position. They are good at that. I don't think I could beat the creationists at debate. I can tie them. But in courtrooms they are terrible, because in courtrooms you cannot give speeches. In a courtroom you have to answer direct questions about the positive status of your belief. We destroyed them in Arkansas. On the second day of the two-week trial we had our victory party!}}

James Kennedy#Criticism and controversy|''Darwin's Deadly Legacy'']]). This has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public. [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and writer [[Edward Humes]] states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/guests/s_493631.html Unintelligent designs on Darwin], [[Edward Humes]], [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There are really two theories of evolution. There is the genuine scientific theory and there is the talk-radio pretend version, designed not to enlighten but to deceive and enrage.

The talk-radio version had a packed town hall up in arms at the &quot;Why Evolution Is Stupid&quot; lecture. In this version of the theory, scientists supposedly believe that all life is accidental, a random crash of molecules that magically produced flowers, horses and humans -- a scenario as unlikely as a tornado in a junkyard assembling a 747. Humans come from monkeys in this theory, just popping into existence one day. The evidence against Darwin is overwhelming, the purveyors of talk-radio evolution rail, yet scientists embrace his ideas because they want to promote atheism.}}

===Europe===

Europeans have often regarded the creation-evolution controversy as an American matter.&lt;ref name=TBO/&gt; However, in recent years the conflict has become an issue in a variety of countries including [[Germany]], [[The United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Poland]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=TBO/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCSE Edis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3642460.stm|publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-09 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author= Roger Highfield |title=Creationists rewrite natural history |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2007/10/02/scihist102.xml |publisher=The Telegraph  |date=2007-02-10 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2007 the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe issued a report on the attempt by American inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools.  It concludes &quot;If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe.... The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist 10 November 2007, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

With declining church attendance, there has been some growth in fundamentalist and Pentecostal Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm Christianity – Pentecostalism] [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the former [[Queensland]] state government of [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], in 1980 lobbying was so successful that Queensland allowed the teaching of creationism as science to school children.  Public lectures have been given in rented rooms at Universities, by visiting American speakers, and speakers with doctorates purchased by mail from Florida sites.&lt;ref&gt;Plimer, Ian &quot;Telling lies for God- Reason versus Creationism&quot;, (Random House)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most acrimonious aspects of the Australian debate was featured on the science television program ''[[Quantum (TV series)|Quantum]]'', about a long-running and ultimately unsuccessful court case by [[Ian Plimer]], Professor of Geology at [[Melbourne University]], against an ordained minister, Dr. Allen Roberts, who had claimed that there were remnants of [[Noah's Ark]] in eastern [[Turkey]].  Although the court found that Dr Roberts had made false and misleading claims, they were not made in the course of trade or commerce, so the case failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;QUANTUM&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/info/97lies.htm &quot;Telling Lies for God&quot;? - One Man's Crusade], accessed 2008-02-05, [[Quantum (TV series)|Quantum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:selex1.svg| thumb | A general overview of in vitro selection protocol. NA stands for Nucleic Acids ([[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]) which start as a random pool, and are enriched through the selection process.]]

'''SELEX''' (&quot;Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment&quot;), also referred to as ''in vitro selection'' or ''in vitro evolution'', is a [[combinatorial]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[ligand]] or ligands.&lt;ref&gt;Ellington, A. D. &amp; Szostak, J. W. (1990) Nature (London) 346, 818-822&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuerk, C. &amp; Gold, L. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. Science. 1990 Aug 3;249(4968):505–510. &lt;/ref&gt; The selected sequences are referred to as [[aptamer]]s.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[primer]]s. For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]]. The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]] to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions is increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences. An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jarosch&quot;&gt;Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S. (2006). In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection. ''Nucleic Acids Res'' 34(12):e86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique has been used to evolve aptamers of extremely high binding affinity to a variety of target ligands, including [[small molecule]]s such as [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dieckmann&quot;&gt;Dieckmann T, Suzuki E, Nakamura GK, Feigon J. (1996). Solution structure of an ATP-binding RNA aptamer reveals a novel fold. ''RNA'' 2(7):628-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[adenosine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Huizenga&quot;&gt;Huizenga DE, Szostak JW. (1995).

(2006). DNA and RNA aptamers: from tools for basic research towards therapeutic applications. ''Comb Chem High Throughput Screen'' 9(8):619-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical uses of the technique are suggested by aptamers that bind [[tumor marker]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira&quot;&gt;Ferreira CS, Matthews CS, Missailidis S. (2006). DNA aptamers that bind to MUC1 tumour marker: design and characterization of MUC1-binding single-stranded DNA aptamers. ''Tumour Biol'' 27(6):289-301.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[clinical trial]]s are underway for a VEGF-binding aptamer trade-named Macugen in treating [[macular degeneration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulrich&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vavvas&quot;&gt;Vavvas D, D'Amico DJ. (2006). Pegaptanib (Macugen): treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration and current role in clinical practice. ''Ophthalmol Clin North Am.'' 19(3):353-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

One caution advanced in relation to the method emphasizes that selection for extremely high, sub-[[nano]]molar binding affinities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carothers&quot;&gt;Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW. (2006). Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand. ''J Am Chem Soc'' 128(24):7929-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

'''Pollination syndromes''' are suites of [[flower]] traits that have evolved in response to [[natural selection]] imposed by different pollen vectors, which can be abiotic (wind and water) or biotic, such as birds, bees, flies, and so forth&lt;ref&gt;Fægri, K. and van der Pijl, L. (1979) The principles of pollination ecology. Pergamon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Proctor M , P. Yeo, and A. Lack |year=1996 |title= The natural history of pollination |publisher=HarperCollins, London.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  These traits include flower shape, size, colour, odour, reward type and amount, nectar composition, timing of flowering, etc.   For example, tubular red flowers with copious nectar often attract birds; foul smelling flowers attract carrion flies or beetles, etc. Pollination syndromes are excellent examples of [[convergent evolution]].

The &quot;classical&quot; pollination syndromes as they are currently defined (see below) were developed in the 19th Century by the Italian botanist [[Federico Delpino]].  Although they have been useful in developing our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions, an uncritical acceptance of pollination syndromes as providing a framework for classifying these relationships is rather out of date&lt;ref&gt;Ollerton, J., Alarcón, R., Waser, N.M., Price, M.V., Watts, S., Cranmer, L., Hingston, A. Peter, C.I. and Rotenberry, J. (2009) A global test of the pollination syndrome hypothesis. Annals of Botany doi:10.1093/aob/mcp031 &lt;/ref&gt;  

==Abiotic pollination syndromes==
These do not attract animal pollinators. Nevertheless, they often have suites of shared traits.
[[Image:Plantago media (2005 07 07).jpg|right|thumb|150px|''[[Plantago media]]'', pollinated by wind or insects]]
====Wind pollination ([[anemophily]])====
Flowers may be small and inconspicuous, green and not showy. They produce enormous numbers of relatively small [[pollen]] grains (hence wind-pollinated plants may be [[allergen]]s, but seldom are animal-pollinated plants allergenic). Their [[stigma]]s may be large and feathery to catch the pollen grains.  Insects may visit them to collect pollen; in some cases these are ineffective pollinators and exert little [[natural selection]] on the flowers, but there are also examples of ambophilous flowers which are both wind and insect pollinated.

====Water pollination ([[hydrophily]])====
Water-pollinated plants are [[aquatic plant|aquatic]] and pollen is released into the water.  Water currents therefore act as a pollen vector in a similar way to wind currents. Their flowers tend to be small and inconspicuous with lots of pollen grains and large, feathery [[stigma]]s to catch the pollen. However, this is relatively uncommon and most aquatic plants are insect-pollinated, with flowers that emerge into the air.

==Biotic pollination syndromes==
[[Image:Helianthus annuus exposed 2004-05-22.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Sunflower]] pollinated by butterflies and bees]]

====Bee pollination (melittophily)====

[[Bee]]-pollinated flowers can be very variable in their size, shape and colouration.  They can be open and bowl-shaped (radially symmetrical) or more complex and non-radially symmetric (&quot;zygomorphic&quot;) such as many [[pea]]s, [[foxglove]]s, etc.

Some bee flowers tend to be yellow or blue, often with ultraviolet [[nectar guide]]s and scent. [[Nectar]], pollen, or both are offered as rewards in varying amounts. The sugar in the nectar tends to be [[sucrose]]-dominated.

There are diverse types of bees, however. [[Honeybee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, [[orchid bee]]s, etc are large groups that are quite distinctive in size, [[tongue]] length and behaviour (some solitary, some colonial). Thus generalization about bees is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenster, CB, WS Armbruster, P Wilson, MR Dudash, and JD Thomson |year=2004 |title=Pollination syndromes and floral specialization | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=35 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some plants can only be pollinated by bees because their [[anthers]] release pollen internally, and it must be shaken out by [[buzz pollination]]. Bees are the only animals that perform this behaviour.

Bee pollination from mobile [[beehives]] is of great economic value for [[orchards]] such as [[apple]] or [[almond]].

====Butterfly pollination (psychophily)====
[[Butterfly]]-pollinated flowers tend to be large and showy, pink or lavender in colour, frequently have a landing area, and are usually scented. Since butterflies do not [[digestion|digest]] pollen (with one exception), more nectar is offered than pollen. The flowers have simple nectar guides with the nectaries usually hidden in narrow tubes or spurs, reached by the long tongue of the butterflies.

====Moth pollination (phalaenophily)====

[[Image:Sphinx 0889.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Day-flying sphinx moth nectaring on [[Brazilian vervain]]]]

Among the more important [[moth]] pollinators are the [[hawk moth]]s ([[Sphingidae]]). Their behaviour is similar to [[hummingbird]]s: they hover in front of flowers with rapid wingbeats. Most are [[nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]]. So moth-pollinated flowers tend to be white, night-opening, large and showy with tubular [[petal|corolla]]s and a strong, sweet scent produced in the evening, night or early morning. A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high [[metabolic rate]]s needed to power their flight.

Other moths ([[Noctuid]]s, [[Geometrid]]s, [[Pyralid]]s, for example) fly slowly and settle on the flower. They do not require as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be aggregated in heads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliveira PE, PE Gibbs, and AA Barbosa |year=2004 |title=Moth pollination of woody species in the Cerrados of Central Brazil: a case of so much owed to so few? |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=245 |issue=1-2 |pages=41–54 |doi=10.1007/s00606-003-0120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Image:Aasblume Aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sapromyophilous ''[[Stapelia]] [[Stapelia gigantea|gigantea]]'']]

====Fly pollination (myophily and sapromyophily)====
The classical syndromes recognise two types of fly pollination: myophily and sapromyophily. Some flies feed on nectar and pollen as adults(particularly [[bee flies]] (Bombyliidae), [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]] (Syrphidae), etc.). Those regularly visit flowers. On the other hand, male [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]] (Tephritidae) are attracted to and feed on specific floral attractant, which acts as fly's sex pheromone precursor or booster, of some wild orchids (Bulbophyllum species - with highly moveable lip) that do not produce nectar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tan, KH and R Nishida |year=2000 |title=Mutual reproductive benefits between a wild orchid, Bulbophyllum patens, and Bactrocera fruit flies via a floral synomone. |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=26 | pages=533–546 |doi=10.1023/A:1005477926244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tan, KH, LT Tan and R Nishida |year=2006 |title= Floral phenylpropanoid cocktail and architecture of Bulbophyllum vinaceum orchid in attracting fruit flies for pollination. |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=32| pages=2429–2441 |doi= 10.1007/s10886-006-9154-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are the myophiles. Sapromyophiles, on the other hand, normally visit dead animals or [[dung]]. They are attracted to flowers that mimic these odoriferous items. They obtain no reward and would quickly leave, but the plant may have traps to slow them down. These plants have a strong, unpleasant odor, and are brown or orange in color. They are not as common as myophilous plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, GD and SD Jones |year=2001 |title=The uses of pollen and its implication for Entomology |journal=Neotropical Entomology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=314–349 |doi=10.1590/S1519-566X2001000300001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Myophilous plants do not tend to have a strong scent, and tend to be purple, violet, blue, and white, open dishes, or tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kastinger C, and A Weber |year=2001 |title=Bee-flies (Bombylius spp., Bombyliidae, Diptera) and the pollination of flowers |journal=Flora |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=3–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they have traditionally been considered to be ineffective and unreliable pollinators, their sheer numbers and the presence of some flies throughout the year make them important pollinators for many plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston |year=2005 |title= The Insects: An Outline of Entomology|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |page=282}} (ISBN 1-4051-1113-5)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Flies tend to be important pollinators in high-[[altitude]] and high-[[latitude]] systems, where they are numerous and other insect groups may be lacking. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Larson BMH, PG Kevan, and DW Inouye |year=2001 |title=Flies and flowers: taxonomic diversity of anthophiles and pollinators |journal=Canadian Entomologist |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=439–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bird pollination ([[ornithophily]])====
Although [[hummingbird]]s are the most familiar nectar-feeding [[bird]]s for [[North America]]ns, there are analogous species in other parts of the world: [[sunbird]]s, [[honeyeater]]s, [[flowerpecker]]s, [[honeycreeper]]s, [[bananaquit]]s, [[Diglossa (bird)|flowerpiercer]]s, [[lories and lorikeets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lotz, CN and JE Schondube |year=2006 |title=Sugar Preferences in Nectar- and Fruit-Eating Birds: Behavioral Patterns and Physiological Causes |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Hummingbirds are the oldest group, with the greatest degree of specialization on nectar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lotz, CN and JE Schondube |year=2006 |title=Sugar Preferences in Nectar- and Fruit-Eating Birds: Behavioral Patterns and Physiological Causes |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Flowers attractive to hummingbirds that can hover in front of the flower tend to be large red or orange tubes with a lot of dilute nectar, secreted during the day. Since birds do not have a strong response to scent, they tend to be odorless. Perching birds need a substantial landing platform, so sunbirds, honeyeaters, and the like are less associated with tubular flowers.

[[Image:Adansonia digitata 20050823 flower.gif|thumb|left|150px|[[African baobab]] (bat-pollinated)]]

====Bat pollination (chiropterophily)====
[[Bat]]-pollinated flowers tend to be large and showy, white or light coloured, open at night and have strong odours. They are often large and [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped. Bats drink the nectar, and these plants typically offer nectar for extended periods of time.  Sight, smell, and [[animal echolocation|echo-location]] are used to initially find the flowers, and excellent spatial memory is used to visit them repeatedly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Von Helversen D, MW Holderied, and O Von Helversen |year=2003 |title=Echoes of bat-pollinated bell-shaped flowers: conspicuous for nectar-feeding bats? |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=1025–1034 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/206/6/1025 |doi=10.1242/jeb.00203 |format=abstract page |pmid=12582145}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact bats can identify nectar-producing flowers using echolocation, a talent that was only recently discovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Von Helversen D, MW Holderied, and O Von Helversen |year=2003 |title=Echoes of bat-pollinated bell-shaped flowers: conspicuous for nectar-feeding bats? |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=1025–1034 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/206/6/1025 |doi=10.1242/jeb.00203 |format=abstract page |pmid=12582145}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the [[New World]], bat pollinated flowers often have [[sulfur]]-scented compounds, but this does not carry to other parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pettersson S, F Ervik, and JT Knudsen |year=2004 |title=Floral scent of bat-pollinated species: West Africa vs. the New World |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=161–168 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111%2Fj.1095-8312.2004.00317.x |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Bat-pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stroo, A. |year=2000 |title=Pollen morphological evolution in bat pollinated plants |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=222 |issue=1-4 |pages=225–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Beetle pollination (cantharophily)====
[[Beetle]]-pollinated flowers are usually large, greenish or off-white in color and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to decaying organic material. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plant's ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston |year=2005 |title= The Insects: An Outline of Entomology|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |page=282}} (ISBN 1-4051-1113-5)&lt;/ref&gt;. Beetles may be particularly important in some parts of the world such as semi-arid areas of [[southern Africa]] and [[southern California]] &lt;ref&gt;Jones, GD and SD Jones (2001). &quot;The uses of pollen and its implication for Entomology&quot;. Neotropical Entomology 30 (3): 314–349. doi:10.1590/S1519-566X2001000300001&lt;/ref&gt; and the montane grasslands of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]([[South Africa]])&lt;ref&gt;Ollerton J., Johnson S.

Pollination syndromes reflect [[convergent evolution]] towards  forms ([[phenotype]]s) that limit the number of species of [[pollinator]]s visiting the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenster, CB, WS Armbruster, P Wilson, MR Dudash, and JD Thomson |year=2004 |title=Pollination syndromes and floral specialization | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=35 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They increase the functional specialization of the plant with regard to pollination, though this may not affect the ecological specialization (i.e. the number of species of pollinators within that functional group)&lt;ref&gt;Ollerton,J., Killick, A., Lamborn, E., Watts, S. &amp; Whiston, M. (2007) Multiple meanings and modes: on the many ways to be a generalist flower. Taxon 56: 717-728&lt;/ref&gt;. They are responses to common selection pressures exerted by shared pollinators or abiotic pollen vectors, which generate correlations among traits. That is, if two distantly related  plant species are both pollinated by nocturnal moths, for example, their flowers will converge on a form which is recognised by the moths (e.g. pale colour, sweet scent, nectar released at the base of a long tube, night-flowering).

===Advantages of specialization===
*Efficiency of pollination: the rewards given to pollinators (commonly nectar or pollen or both, but sometimes oil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buchmann, SL. |year=1987 |title=The ecology of oil flowers and their bees |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=18 |pages=343–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.002015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, scents, resins or wax) may be costly to produce. Nectar can be cheap, but pollen is generally expensive as it is relatively high in nitrogen compounds.  Plants have evolved to obtain the maximum pollen transfer for the minimum reward. Different pollinators, because of their size, shape, or behaviour, have different efficiencies of transfer of pollen. And the floral traits affect efficiency of transfer:  [[Aquilegia|columbine]] flowers were experimentally altered and presented to [[Sphingidae|hawkmoth]]s, and flower orientation, shape and colour were found to affect visitation rates or pollen removal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fulton M and  Hodges SA |year=1999 |title=Floral isolation between ''Aquilegia formosa'' and ''A. pubescens.'' |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B|volume= 266 |pages=2247–2252 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hodges SA, JB Whittall, M Fulton, and JY Yang  |year=2002 |title=Genetics of floral traits influencing reproductive isolation between ''Aquilegia formosa'' and ''A. pubescens'' |journal=American Naturalist |volume=159 |pages=S51–S60 |doi=10.1086/338372}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Pollinator constancy: to efficiently transfer pollen, it is best for the plant if the pollinator focuses on one species of plant, ignoring other species. Otherwise, pollen may be dropped uselessly on the  [[stigma]]s of other species. Animals, of course, do not aim to pollinate, they aim to collect food as fast as they can. However, many pollinator species exhibit constancy, passing up available flowers to focus on one plant species. Why should animals specialize on a plant species, rather than move to the next flower of any species? Although pollinator constancy  was recognized by [[Aristotle]], we don’t fully understand the benefits to animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gegear, RJ and TM Laverty |year=2005 |title=Flower constancy in bumblebees: a test of the trait variability hypothesis |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=939–949 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.06.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most common hypothesis is that pollinators must learn to handle particular types of flowers, and they have limited capacity to learn different types. They can only efficiently gather rewards from one type of flower.

Pollinator constancy: these honeybees selectively visit flowers from only one species, as can be seen by the colour of the pollen in their baskets:

[[Image:TwoBees.jpg|thumb|left|400px|'''Pollinator constancy''': these two honeybees, active at the same time and place, selectively visit flowers from only one species, as can be seen by the colour of the pollen in their baskets]]--&gt;

===Advantages of generalization ===

Pollinators fluctuate in abundance and activity independently of their plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pettersson MW |year=1991 |title=Pollination by a guild of fluctuating moth populations: option for unspecialization in ''Silene vulgaris''  |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=79 |pages= 591–604 |doi=10.2307/2260655}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ollerton,J., Killick, A., Lamborn, E., Watts, S. &amp; Whiston, M. (2007) Multiple meanings and modes: on the many ways to be a generalist flower. Taxon 56: 717-728&lt;/ref&gt;, and any one species may fail to pollinate a plant in a particular year.  Thus a plant may be at an advantage if it attracts several species or types of pollinators, ensuring pollen transfer every year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Waser, NM, L Chittka, MV Price, NM Williams and J. Ollerton  |year=1996 |title=Generalization in pollination systems, and why it matters  |journal=Ecology |volume=77 |pages=1043–1060 |doi=10.2307/2265575}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Plants do, in many species, have the back-up option of self-pollination, if they are not self-incompatible.

===Criticisms of the syndromes===

Whilst it is clear that pollination syndromes can be observed in nature, there has been much debate amongst scientists as to how frequent they are and to what extent we can use the classical syndromes to classify plant-pollinator interactions &lt;ref&gt;Ollerton, J. (1998) Sunbird surprise for syndromes. Nature 394: 726-727&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although some species of plants are visited only by one type of animal (i.e. they are functionally specialized), many plant species are visited by very different [[pollinator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Herrera, CM  |year=1996 |title=Floral traits and adaptation to insect pollinators: a devil’s advocate approach |encyclopedia=Floral Biology |editor= DG Lloyd &amp; SCH Barrett |pages=65–87 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Waser, NM, L Chittka, MV Price, NM Williams and J. Ollerton  |year=1996 |title=Generalization in pollination systems, and why it matters  |journal=Ecology |volume=77 |pages=1043–1060 |doi=10.2307/2265575}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a flower may be pollinated by bees, butterflies and birds.  Strict specialization of plants relying on one species of pollinator is relatively rare, probably because it can result in variable reproductive success across years as pollinator populations vary significantly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Waser, NM, L Chittka, MV Price, NM Williams and J. Ollerton  |year=1996 |title=Generalization in pollination systems, and why it matters  |journal=Ecology |volume=77 |pages=1043–1060 |doi=10.2307/2265575}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In such cases, plants should generalize on a wide range of pollinators, and such ecological generalization is frequently found in nature.  A study in Tasmania found the syndromes did not usefully predict the pollinators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hingston, AB and PB Mcquillan |year=2000 |title=Are pollination syndromes useful predictors of floral visitors in Tasmania? |journal=Australian Journal of Ecology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages= 600–609 |doi=10.1046/j.1442-9993.2000.01059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This debate has led to a critical re-evaluation of the syndromes, which suggests that on average about one third of the flowering plants can be classified into the classical syndromes &lt;ref&gt;Ollerton, J., Alarcón, R., Waser, N.M., Price, M.V., Watts, S., Cranmer, L., Hingston, A. Peter, C.I. and Rotenberry, J. (2009) A global test of the pollination syndrome hypothesis. Annals of Botany doi:10.1093/aob/mcp031 &lt;/ref&gt;.  This reflects the fact that nature is much less predictable and straightforward than 19th Century biologists originally thought.  Pollination syndromes can be thought of as extremes of a continuum of greater or lesser specialization or generalization onto particular functional groups of pollinators that exert similar selective pressures”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenster, CB, WS Armbruster, P Wilson, MR Dudash, and JD Thomson |year=2004 |title=Pollination syndromes and floral specialization | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=35 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the frequency with which flowers conform to the expectations of the pollination syndromes is relatively rare.  In addition, new types of plant-pollinator interaction, involving &quot;unusual&quot; pollinating animals are regularly being discovered, such as specialized pollination by spider hunting wasps ([[Pompilidae]]) and fruit chafers ([[Cetoniidae]]) in the eastern grasslands of South Africa&lt;ref&gt;Ollerton J., Johnson S. D., Cranmer, L. and Kellie, S. (2003) The pollination ecology of an assemblage of grassland asclepiads in South Africa. Annals of Botany 92: 807-834.&lt;/ref&gt;  These plants do not fit into the classical syndromes, though they may show evidence of convergent evolution in their own right.     

An analysis of flower traits and visitation in 49 species in the plant genus ''[[Penstemon]]''found that it was possible to separate bird- and bee- pollinated species quite well, but only by using floral traits which were not considered in the classical accounts of syndromes, such as the details of anther opening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wilson, P, M Castellanos, JN Hogue, JD Thomson and WS Armbruster |year=2004 |title=A multivariate search for pollination syndromes among penstemons. |journal=Oikos |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=345–361 |doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12819.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   Although a recent review concluded that there is “overwhelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenster, CB, WS Armbruster, P Wilson, MR Dudash, and JD Thomson |year=2004 |title=Pollination syndromes and floral specialization | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=35 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132347}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the sheer complexity and subtlety of plant-pollinator interactions (and the growing recognition that non-pollinating organisms such as seed predators can affect the evolution of flower traits) means that this debate is likely to continue for some time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Negligible senescence'' refers to a very few animals that do not display symptoms of aging. More specifically, negligibly senescent animals do not have measurable reductions in their reproductive capability with age, or measurable functional decline with age. Death rates in negligibly senescent animals do not increase with age as they do in senescent organisms. 

Some fish, such as some varieties of sturgeon and rockfish, and some tortoises and turtles

''Maritime Biology'' '''71''':209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; can be measured by examining growth patterns similar to [[tree rings]] on the [[otoliths]] (parts of motion sensing organs).

Of course, species displaying negligible aging still die of other causes and so extremely old individuals are extremely rare. Since relatively few animals have been examined, the ultimate life span achievable by such an animal is not known.

In [[biology]], '''evolution''' is change in the [[genetic material]] of a population of [[organisms]] from one generation to the next. Though the changes produced in any one generation are small, differences accumulate with each generation and can, over time, cause substantial changes in the organisms. This process can culminate in the [[speciation|emergence of new species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref |id=Gould-2002 |text=Gould 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the similarities between organisms suggest that all known [[species]] are [[common descent|descended from a common ancestor]] (or ancestral [[gene pool]]) through this process of gradual divergence.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |year=2005 |title=Evolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0-87893-187-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The basis of evolution is the [[gene]]s that are passed on from generation to generation; these produce an organism's inherited [[trait (biology)|traits]]. These traits vary within populations, with organisms showing [[genetic variation|heritable differences]] (variation) in their traits. Evolution itself is the product of two opposing forces: processes that constantly introduce variation, and processes that make variants become more common or rare. New variation arises in two main ways: either from [[mutation]]s in genes, or from the transfer of genes between populations and between species. In species that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], new combinations of genes are also produced by [[genetic recombination]], which can increase variation between organisms.

Two major mechanisms determine which variants will become more common or rare in a population. One is [[natural selection]], a process that causes helpful traits (those that increase the chance of survival and reproduction) to become more common in a population and causes harmful traits to become more rare. This occurs because individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce, meaning that more individuals in the next generation will inherit these traits.&lt;ref name=Futuyma/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lande&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lande R, Arnold SJ |year=1983 |title=The measurement of selection on correlated characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |pages=1210–26|doi=10.2307/2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over many generations, [[adaptation]]s occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of the variants best-suited for their environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayala&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala FJ |title=Darwin's greatest discovery: design without designer |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=8567–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17494753 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/suppl.1/8567.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701072104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major mechanism driving evolution is [[genetic drift]], an independent process that produces random changes in the frequency of traits in a population. Genetic drift results from the role that [[probability|chance]] plays in whether a given trait will be passed on as individuals survive and reproduce.

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] document the [[Fact#Fact in science|fact]] that evolution occurs, and also develop and test [[Theory#Science|theories]] that explain its causes. The study of evolutionary biology began in the mid-nineteenth century, when studies of the [[fossil|fossil record]] and the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] of living organisms convinced most scientists that species changed over time.&lt;ref name=EarlyModernGeology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect2.htm |title=History of Science: Early Modern Geology |accessdate=2008-01-15 |author=Ian C.

Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable [[trait (biology)|traits]] – particular characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[eye color]] is an inherited characteristic, which individuals can inherit from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–66 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, not every aspect of an organism's phenotype is inherited. [[sun tanning|Suntanned]] skin results from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, people have different responses to sunlight, arising from differences in their genotype; a striking example is individuals with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan and are highly sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006/&gt; DNA is a [[polymer]] composed of four types of [[nucleobase|bases]]. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters specifying a sentence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called [[gene]]s; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. A specific location within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. 

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

==Variation==
{{details more|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's [[phenotype]] results from both its [[genotype]] and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; The [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will fluctuate, becoming more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Evolutionary [[force]]s act by driving these changes in allele frequency in one direction or another. Variation disappears when an allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] — when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name=Amos&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harwood AJ |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=Philos.

Variation comes from [[mutation]]s in [[genetic material]], migration between populations ([[gene flow]]), and the reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]]. Variation also comes from exchanges of genes between different species; for example, through [[horizontal gene transfer]] in [[bacteria]], and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Draghi J, Turner P |title=DNA secretion and gene-level selection in bacteria |journal=Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) |volume=152 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2683–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16946263}}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Mallet J |title=Hybrid speciation |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=279–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17361174 |doi=10.1038/nature05706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the constant introduction of variation through these processes, most of the [[genome]] of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Butlin RK, Tregenza T |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philos.

===Mutation===

[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|100px|left|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Genetic variation comes from [[randomness|random]] mutations that occur in the genomes of organisms. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are caused by [[Radioactive decay|radiation]], [[virus]]es, [[transposon]]s and [[mutagen|mutagenic chemicals]], as well as errors that occur during [[meiosis]] or [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertram J |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=Mol.

Changes in chromosome number may involve even larger mutations, where segments of the DNA within chromosomes break and then rearrange.

===Sex and recombination===
{{details more|Genetic recombination|Sexual reproduction}}
In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes in other organisms during reproduction. However, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through [[independent assortment]]. In the related process of [[genetic recombination]], sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Radding C |title=Homologous pairing and strand exchange in genetic recombination |journal=Annu.

Recombination allows even alleles that are close together in a strand of DNA to be [[Mendelian inheritance#Mendel.27s law of segregation|inherited independently]]. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other, and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lien S, Szyda J, Schechinger B, Rappold G, Arnheim N |title=Evidence for heterogeneity in recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region: high resolution analysis by sperm typing and radiation-hybrid mapping |journal=Am.

From a genetic viewpoint, evolution is a ''generation-to-generation change in the frequencies of alleles within a population that shares a common gene pool''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoltzfus A |title=Mutationism and the dual causation of evolutionary change |journal=Evol. Dev. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=304–17 |year=2006 |pmid=16686641 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[population]] is a localized group of individuals belonging to the same species. For example, all of the moths of the same species living in an isolated forest represent a population. A single gene in this population may have several alternate forms, which account for variations between the phenotypes of the organisms. An example might be a gene for coloration in moths that has two alleles: black and white. A [[gene pool]] is the complete set of alleles for a gene in a single population; the [[allele frequency]] measures the fraction of the gene pool comprised of a single allele (for example, what fraction of moth coloration genes are the black allele). Evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms; for example, the allele for black color in a population of moths becoming more common.

To understand the mechanisms that cause a population to evolve, it is useful to consider what conditions are required for a population not to evolve. The ''[[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]'' states that the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if the only forces acting on that population are the random reshuffling of alleles during the formation of the sperm or egg, and the random combination of the alleles in these sex cells during [[Fertilisation|fertilization]].&lt;ref name=oneil&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/synthetic/synth_2.htm|title= Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Model|accessdate=2008-01-06 |last= O'Neil |first=Dennis |year=2008 |work= The synthetic theory of evolution: An introduction to modern evolutionary concepts and theories|publisher=Behavioral Sciences Department, Palomar College }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a population is said to be in ''Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium'' - it is not evolving.&lt;ref name= Teach2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evoled.org/lessons/speciation.htm|title= Causes of evolution|accessdate=2007-12-30 |last= Bright |first=Kerry |year=2006 |work= Teach Evolution and Make It Relevant |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion waiting in Nambia.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Male [[lion]]s leave the pride where they are born and take over a new pride to mate. This results in [[gene flow]] between prides.]]

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]].

Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies, as well as introducing genetic variation into a population. Immigration may add new genetic material to the established [[gene pool]] of a population. Conversely, emigration may remove genetic material. As [[reproductive isolation|barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]], gene flow may slow this process by spreading genetic differences between the populations. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the flow of plant genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Su H, Qu L, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H |title=The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? |journal=Heredity |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=212–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12634804 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
The two main mechanisms that produce evolution are [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]]. Natural selection favors genes that improve capacity for survival and reproduction. Genetic drift is random change in the frequency of alleles, caused by the random sampling of a generation's genes during reproduction. The relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift in a population varies depending on the strength of the selection and the [[effective population size]], which is the number of individuals capable of breeding.&lt;ref name=Whitlock&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitlock M |title=Fixation probability and time in subdivided populations |journal=Genetics |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=767–79 |year=2003 |pmid=12807795 |pmc=1462574 |month=June |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection usually predominates in large populations, while genetic drift dominates in small populations. The dominance of genetic drift in small populations can even lead to the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.&lt;ref name=Ohta&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta T |title=Near-neutrality in evolution of genes and gene regulation |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/252626899v1 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc.

U.S.A.]] |volume=99 |issue=25 |pages=16134–7 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.252626899 |pmid=12461171}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, changing population size can dramatically influence the course of evolution. [[Population bottleneck]]s, where the population shrinks temporarily and therefore loses genetic variation, result in a more uniform population.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{details more|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]

[[Natural selection]] is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become, and remain, more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a &quot;self-evident&quot; mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
* Heritable variation exists within populations of organisms.
* Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
* These offspring vary in their ability to survive and reproduce.

These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors pass these advantageous traits on, while traits that do not confer an advantage are not passed on to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Hurst&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurst LD |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19119264 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism. This measures the organism's genetic contribution to the next generation. However, this is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness measures the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.&lt;ref name=Haldane&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haldane J |title=The theory of natural selection today |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4663 |pages=710–3 |year=1959 |pmid=13644170 | doi=10.1038/183710a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, if an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be &quot;selected ''for''&quot;. Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival, and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer — they are &quot;selected ''against''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lande/&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic, if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Futuyma&quot;/&gt;

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorized into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time — for example organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=16 |pages=9157–60 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11470913 |pmc=55389 |doi=10.1073/pnas.161281098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, [[disruptive selection]] is selection for extreme trait values and often results in [[bimodal distribution|two different values]] becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilizing selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name=Hurst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–95 |year=1979 |pmid=17248980 |pmc=1214112 |month=November |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

A special case of natural selection is [[sexual selection]], which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andersson M, Simmons L |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends Ecol. Evol. (Amst.) |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=296–302 |year=2006 |pmid=16769428 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent in males of some animal species, despite traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls or bright colors that attract predators, decreasing the survival of individual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kokko H, Brooks R, McNamara J, Houston A |title=The sexual selection continuum |pmc=1691039 |journal=Proc.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals, and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive.  &quot;Nature&quot; in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[abiotic|physical]] as well as [[biotic|biological]], in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odum1971&quot;&gt;Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt;  Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system.  These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]], and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection. 

An active area of research is the [[unit of selection]], with natural selection being proposed to work at the level of genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and even species.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal=Philos.

===Genetic drift===
{{details more|Genetic drift|Effective population size}}
[[File:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|right|250px| Simulation of [[genetic drift]] of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top) and 100 (bottom). Drift to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] is more rapid in the smaller population.]]
Genetic drift is the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles in offspring are a [[sampling (statistics)|random sample]] of those in the parents, as well as from the role that chance plays in determining whether a given individual will survive and reproduce.&lt;ref name=Amos/&gt; In mathematical terms, alleles are subject to [[sampling error]]. As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to &quot;drift&quot; upward or downward randomly (in a [[random walk]]). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]], either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lande R |title=Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal=Genome |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=221–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2687093}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The time for an allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Otto S, Whitlock M |title=The probability of fixation in populations of changing size |journal=Genetics |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=723–33 |year=1997 |pmid=9178020 |pmc=1208011 |month=June |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise measure of population that is important is called the [[effective population size]]. The effective population is always smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the number of animals that are too old or young to breed, and the lower probability of animals that live far apart managing to mate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charlesworth B |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: Effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation |journal=Nat.

Although natural selection is responsible for adaptation, the relative importance of the two forces of natural selection and genetic drift in driving evolutionary change in general is an area of current research in evolutionary biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nei M |title=Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution |doi= 10.1093/molbev/msi242 |journal=Mol.

==Outcomes==
Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behavior of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioral and physical [[adaptation]]s that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are sometimes divided into [[macroevolution]], which is evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, such as [[extinction]] and [[speciation]], and [[microevolution]], which is smaller evolutionary changes, such as adaptations, within a species or population.&lt;ref name=ScottEC&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels - with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes acting on entire species and affecting the rate of speciation and extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikiref |id=Gould-2002 |text=Gould 2002, pp. 657–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

===Adaptation===
{{details|Adaptation}}

Adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, George C. 1966. ''Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. Princeton. &quot;Evolutionary adaptation is a phenomenon of pervasive importance in biology.&quot; p5&lt;/ref&gt; and is the ''process'' whereby an organism becomes better suited to its [[habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst 1982. ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p483: &quot;Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' defines ''adaptation'' as &quot;Any change in the structure or functioning of an organism that makes it better suited to its environment&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass, or the ability of horses to run fast and escape predators. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process, and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orr H |title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15716908 |doi=10.1038/nrg1523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following definitions are due to [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]. 
:1. ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its [[habitat]] or habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky T. 1968. On some fundamental concepts of evolutionary biology. ''Evolutionary biology'' '''2''', 1&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:2. ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky T. 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. Columbia, N.Y. p4&amp;ndash;6, 79&amp;ndash;82, 84&amp;ndash;87&lt;/ref&gt;
:3. An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky T. 1956. Genetics of natural populations XXV. Genetic changes in populations of ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosphila persimilis'' in some locations in California. ''Evolution'' '''10''', 82&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to [[antibiotic]] selection, with genetic changes causing [[antibiotic resistance]] by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nakajima A, Sugimoto Y, Yoneyama H, Nakae T |title=High-level fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to interplay of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and the DNA gyrase mutation |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mandi/46/6/46_391/_article/-char/en |journal=Microbiol.

However, many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact [[exaptation]]s: structures originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process.&lt;ref name=GouldStructP1235&gt;{{wikiref |id=Gould-2002 |text=Gould 2002, pp. 1235–6}} &lt;/ref&gt; One example is the African lizard ''Holaspis guentheri'', which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives.

As adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures, structures with similar internal organization may have very different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are structurally similar to both human hands and seal flippers, due to the common descent of these structures from an ancestor that also had five digits at the end of each forelimb. Other idiosyncratic anatomical features, such as [[sesamoid bone|bones in the wrist]] of the [[Giant Panda|panda]] being formed into a false &quot;thumb,&quot; indicate that an organism's evolutionary lineage can limit what adaptations are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salesa MJ, Antón M, Peigné S, Morales J |title=Evidence of a false thumb in a fossil carnivore clarifies the evolution of pandas |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/2/379.full |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proc.

===Co-evolution===
{{details more|Co-evolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a [[Predation|predator]] and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called [[co-evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wade MJ |title=The co-evolutionary genetics of ecological communities |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=185–95 |year=2007 |pmid=17279094 |doi=10.1038/nrg2031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the production of [[tetrodotoxin]] in the [[rough-skinned newt]] and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the [[Common Garter Snake|common garter snake]]. In this predator-prey pair, an [[evolutionary arms race]] has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of resistance in the snake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geffeney S, Brodie ED, Ruben PC, Brodie ED |title=Mechanisms of adaptation in a predator-prey arms race: TTX-resistant sodium channels |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1336–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12193784 |doi=10.1126/science.1074310 }}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Brodie ED, Ridenhour BJ, Brodie ED |title=The evolutionary response of predators to dangerous prey: hotspots and coldspots in the geographic mosaic of coevolution between garter snakes and newts |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=2067–82 |year=2002 |pmid=12449493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-operation===
{{details more|Co-operation (evolution)}}
However, not all interactions between species involve conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sachs J |title=Cooperation within and among species |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1415–8; discussion 1426–36 |year=2006 |pmid=16910971 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01152.x }}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Nowak M |title=Five rules for the evolution of cooperation |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5805 |pages=1560–3 |year=2006 |pmid=17158317 |doi=10.1126/science.1133755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paszkowski U |title=Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal=Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=364–70 |year=2006 |pmid=16713732 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocal]] relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending [[signal transduction|signals]] that suppress the plant [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hause B, Fester T |title=Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal=Planta |volume=221 |issue=2 |pages=184–96 |year=2005 |pmid=15871030 |doi=10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in [[Eusociality|social insect]]s, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the [[somatic cell]]s that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's [[germ cell]]s to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name=Bertram/&gt;

These examples of cooperation within species are thought to have evolved through the process of [[kin selection]], which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reeve HK, Hölldobler B |title=The emergence of a superorganism through intergroup competition |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0703466104 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume=104 |issue=23 |pages=9736–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17517608}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is selected for because if the ''helping'' individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will ''also'' contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Axelrod R, Hamilton W |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4489 |pages=1390–6 | year = 2005 |pmid=7466396 |doi=10.1126/science.7466396 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other processes that may promote cooperation include [[group selection]], where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson EO, Hölldobler B |title=Eusociality: origin and consequences |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0505858102 |journal=Proc.

===Speciation===
{{details more|Speciation}}

[[Speciation]] is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gavrilets S |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–215 |year=2003 |pmid=14628909 |doi=10.1554/02-727}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary biologists view species as statistical phenomena and not categories or types. This view is counterintuitive since the classical idea of species is still widely held, with a species seen as a class of organisms exemplified by a &quot;[[Biological type|type specimen]]&quot; that bears all the traits common to this species.

There are four mechanisms for speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=12 |pages=4792–5 |pmid=18344323 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711998105 | author= Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B.; Backeljau, T.; Breugelmans, K.; Grbac, I.; Van Damme, R.; Irschick, D.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Losos1997&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |title=Adaptive differentiation following experimental island colonization in Anolis lizards| journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6628 |pages=70–3 |doi=10.1038/387070a0 |author=Losos, J.B.

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation through both rapid genetic drift and selection on a small gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Templeton AR |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–38 |year=1980 |pmid=6777243 |month=Apr |day=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name=Gavrilets/&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localized metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Antonovics J |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16639420 |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produces a change in flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, causing reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nosil P, Crespi B, Gries R, Gries G |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–27 |year=2007 |pmid=16900317 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Darwin's finches cropped.jpeg|frame|right|[[Geographical isolation]] of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] on the [[Galápagos Islands]] produced over a dozen new species.]]

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]]. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form a matching pair during meiosis, since as each parent's chromosomes is represented by a pair already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hegarty Mf, Hiscock SJ |title=Genomic clues to the evolutionary success of polyploid plants |journal=Current Biology |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=435–44 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.03.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''Arabidopsis arenosa'' cross-bred to give the new species ''Arabidopsis suecica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jakobsson M, Hagenblad J, Tavaré S, ''et al.'' |title=A unique recent origin of the allotetraploid species Arabidopsis suecica: Evidence from nuclear DNA markers |journal=Mol.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short &quot;bursts&quot; of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972.

Press. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population, and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats, and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6764 |journal=Proc.

The role of extinction in evolution depends on which type is considered. The causes of the continuous &quot;low-level&quot; extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, are not well understood and may be the result of competition between species for limited resources ([[competitive exclusion]]).&lt;ref name=Kutschera/&gt; If competition from other species does alter the probability that a species will become extinct, this could produce [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] as a level of natural selection.&lt;ref name=Gould/&gt; The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of [[Adaptive radiation|rapid evolution]] and speciation in survivors.&lt;ref name=Raup/&gt;

==History of evolutionary thought==
{{details|History of evolutionary thought}}
[[File:Charles Darwin aged 51 crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Charles Darwin]] at age 51, just after publishing ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.]]
Evolutionary ideas such as [[common descent]] and the [[transmutation of species]] have existed since at least the 6th century BC, when they were expounded by the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Anaximander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wright, S|year=1984|title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 1: Genetic and Biometric Foundations|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-91038-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others who considered such ideas included the Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]], the [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosopher-poet]] [[Lucretius]], the [[Islamic science|Arab biologist]] [[Al-Jahiz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zirkle C |title=Natural Selection before the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |year=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Persian philosopher]] [[Ibn Miskawayh]], the [[Brethren of Purity]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', p. 143-144. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chinese philosopher [[Zhuangzi]].&lt;ref&gt; &quot;A Source Book In Chinese Philosophy&quot;, Chan, Wing-Tsit, p. 204, 1962. &lt;/ref&gt;  As biological knowledge grew in the 18th century, evolutionary ideas were set out by a few natural philosophers including [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre Maupertuis]] in 1745 and [[Erasmus Darwin]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terrall, M|year=2002|title=The Man Who Flattened the Earth: Maupertuis and the Sciences in the Enlightenment|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226793610}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of the biologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] about [[transmutation of species]] had wide influence. [[Charles Darwin]] formulated his idea of [[natural selection]] in 1838 and was still developing his theory in 1858 when [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] sent him a similar theory, and both were presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] in [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|separate papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wallace, A|coauthors= Darwin, C|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F350&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1|title=On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties, and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London.

Debate about the mechanisms of evolution continued, and Darwin could not explain the source of the heritable variations which would be acted on by natural selection. Like Lamarck, he thought that parents [[inheritance of acquired characters|passed on adaptations acquired]] during their lifetimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F391&amp;pageseq=136 |title=Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection |accessdate=2007-12-28 |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1872 |work=[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]. 6th edition, p. 108 |publisher=John Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; a theory which was subsequently dubbed [[Lamarckism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leakey, Richard E.; Darwin, Charles |title=The illustrated origin of species |publisher=Faber |location=London |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-571-14586-8 |oclc= |doi=}} p. 17-18 &lt;!--superseded source {{cite journal |author=Stafleu F |title=Lamarck: The birth of biology |journal=Taxon |volume=20 |issue= |pages=397–442 |year=1971 |pmid=11636092 |doi=10.2307/1218244 }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s [[August Weismann|August Weismann's]] experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse were not heritable, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favour.&lt;ref name= ImaginaryLamarck&gt;{{citation |last =Ghiselin | first = Michael T.|authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | publication-date = September/October 1994| contribution =Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' | contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm| title =The Textbook Letter | publisher =The Textbook League | url =http://www.textbookleague.org/|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Magner, LN|year=2002|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|publisher=CRC|isbn=978-0824708245}}&lt;/ref&gt; More significantly, Darwin could not account for how traits were passed down from generation to generation. In 1865 [[Gregor Mendel]] found that traits were [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]] in a predictable manner.&lt;ref name=Weiling&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiling F |title=Historical study: Johann Gregor Mendel 1822–1884 |journal=Am.

Yet it was the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel’s pioneering work on the fundamentals of genetics (of which Darwin and Wallace were unaware) by [[Hugo de Vries]] and others in the early 1900s that provided the impetus for a better understanding of how variation occurs in plant and animal traits. That variation is the main fuel used by natural selection to shape the wide variety of adaptive traits observed in organic life. Even though [[Hugo de Vries]] and other early geneticists were very critical of the theory of evolution, their rediscovery of and subsequent work on genetics eventually provided a solid basis on which the theory of evolution stood even more convincingly than when it was originally proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, D.

Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent contradiction between Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and Mendel’s work was reconciled in the 1920s and 1930s by evolutionary biologists such as [[J.B.S. Haldane]], [[Sewall Wright]], and particularly [[Ronald Fisher]], who set the foundations for the establishment of the field of [[population genetics]]. The end result was a combination of evolution by natural selection and Mendelian inheritance, the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bowler | first = Peter J. | authorlink = Peter J.

In its early history, evolutionary biology primarily drew in scientists from traditional taxonomically oriented disciplines, whose specialist training in particular organisms addressed general questions in evolution. As evolutionary biology expanded as an academic discipline, particularly after the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis, it began to draw more widely from the biological sciences.&lt;ref name=Kutschera/&gt; Currently the study of evolutionary biology involves scientists from fields as diverse as [[biochemistry]], [[ecology]], [[genetics]] and [[physiology]], and evolutionary concepts are used in even more distant disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] and [[computer science]]. In the 21st century, [[current research in evolutionary biology]] deals with several areas where the modern evolutionary synthesis may need modification or extension, such as assessing the relative importance of various ideas on the [[unit of selection]] and [[evolvability]] and how to fully incorporate the findings of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pigliucci M |title=Do we need an extended evolutionary synthesis? |journal=Evolution |volume=61 |issue=12 |pages=2743–9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17924956 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Winther RG |title=Systemic darwinism |journal=Proc.

[[File:Darwin ape.jpg|right|150px|thumb|As &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot; became widely accepted in the 1870s, [[caricature]]s of [[Charles Darwin]] with a [[quadrupedal]] [[ape]] or [[monkey]] body symbolised evolution.&lt;ref name=Browne2003e&gt;{{cite book|author=Browne, Janet |title=Charles Darwin: The Power of Place |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |year=2003 |pages=376–379 |isbn=0-7126-6837-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centered on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Nowadays, the fact that organisms evolve is uncontested in the [[scientific literature]] and the modern evolutionary synthesis is widely accepted by scientists.&lt;ref name=Kutschera/&gt; However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the philosophical, religious, and cosmological controversies, see: {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Dennett|last=Dennett|first=D|title=[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea|Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life]]|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=978-0684824710}}&lt;br /&gt;*For the scientific and social reception of evolution in the 19th and early 20th centuries, see: {{cite web | last = Johnston | first = Ian C. | title = History of Science: Origins of Evolutionary Theory | work = And Still We Evolve | publisher = Liberal Studies Department, Malaspina University College | url =http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/darwin/sect3.htm| accessdate =2007-05-24}}&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite book|authorlink=Peter J.

While [[Level of support for evolution#Support for evolution by religious bodies|various religions and denominations]] have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through concepts such as [[theistic evolution]], there are [[creationism|creationists]] who believe that evolution is contradicted by the [[creation myth]]s found in their respective religions and who raise various [[objections to evolution]].&lt;ref name=Ross2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ross, M.R. | year = 2005 | title = Who Believes What?

==Applications==

Evolutionary biology, and in particular the understanding of how organisms evolve through natural selection, is an area of science with many practical applications.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bull JJ, Wichman HA |title=Applied evolution |journal=Annu Rev Ecol Syst |volume=32 |pages=183–217 |year=2001 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major technological application of evolution is [[artificial selection]], which is the intentional selection of certain traits in a population of organisms. Humans have used artificial selection for thousands of years in the [[domestication]] of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doebley JF, Gaut BS, Smith BD |title=The molecular genetics of crop domestication |journal=Cell |volume=127 |issue=7 |pages=1309–21 |year=2006 |pmid=17190597 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, such selection has become a vital part of [[genetic engineering]], with [[selectable marker]]s such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA in [[molecular biology]]. It is also possible to use repeated rounds of mutation and selection to evolve proteins with particular properties, such as modified [[enzyme]]s or new [[antibody|antibodies]], in a process called [[directed evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jäckel C, Kast P, Hilvert D |title=Protein design by directed evolution |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |issue= |pages=153–73 |year=2008 |pmid=18573077 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evolution can produce highly optimized processes and networks, it has many applications in [[computer science]]. Here, simulations of evolution using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognized optimization method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie - Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn = 0262581116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming| subtitle=On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection | publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0262111705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimize the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jamshidi M |title=Tools for intelligent control: fuzzy controllers, neural networks and genetic algorithms |journal=Philosophical transactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[biology]], memory is present if the state of a biological system depends on its past history in addition to present conditions. If this memory is recorded in the genetic material and stably inherited through cell division ([[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]), it is genetic.

===Molecular biology===
In [[molecular biology]], genetic memory resides in the [[genetic material]] of the cell and is expressed via the [[genetic code]] used to translate it into [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4880506&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nirenberg M |title=Genetic memory |journal=JAMA |volume=206 |issue=9 |pages=1973–7 |year=1968 |pmid=4880506 |doi=10.1001/jama.206.9.1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nirenberg&quot;&gt;[[Marshall Nirenberg]] (1968): &quot;The genetic code&quot;. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/nirenberg-lecture.pdf Nobel Lecture]&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic code enables cells to decode the information needed to construct the protein molecules that make up living cells and therefore record and store a one-dimensional blueprint for all the parts that make up an organism. This blueprint or genetic memory in the form of species-specific collections of [[gene]]s ([[genotype]] or [[genome]]) is passed from cell to cell and from generation to generation in the form of [[DNA]] molecules. DNA therefore functions as a template for protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nirenberg&quot;/&gt; Genetic memory can be modified by ''[[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] memory'', a process by which changes in [[gene expression]] are passed on through mitosis or meiosis through factors other than DNA sequence.

===Somatic memory===
''Somatic memory'' is limited to the organism and not passed on to subsequent generations. However, its mechanism may involve mitotically stable genetic memory. The term applies for cellular memory, animals' memory, and plants' memory, as described in the following paragraphs.

====Cellular memory====
All cells in multicellular organisms are derived from a [[pluripotent]] [[zygote]] and contain the same genetic material (with a few exceptions). However, they are capable of recording a history of their development within the organism leading to their specialized functions and limitations. Cells often employ [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] processes that affect DNA-protein interactions to record this ''cellular memory'' in the form of [[mitosis|mitotically]] stable changes of the genetic material without a change in the [[DNA]] sequence itself. This is typically achieved via changes of the [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17416595&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hirose S |title=Crucial roles for chromatin dynamics in cellular memory |journal=J. Biochem. |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=615–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17416595 |doi=10.1093/jb/mvm092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[methylation]] patterns of the DNA molecule itself and proteins involved in packaging DNA, such as [[histone]]s (also referred to as &quot;histone code&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11782440&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12419240&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turner BM |title=Cellular memory and the histone code |journal=Cell |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=285–91 |year=2002 |pmid=12419240 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In animals====
A case of somatic genetic memory is the ''immunological memory'' of the [[adaptive immune response]] in [[vertebrate]]s. The immune system is capable of learning to recognize pathogens and keeping a memory of this learning process, which is the basis of the success of [[vaccination]]s. [[Antibody]] genes in B and T [[lymphocyte]]s are assembled from separate gene segments, giving each lymphocyte a unique antibody coding sequence leading to the vast diversity of antibodies in the immune system. If stimulated by an [[antigen]] (e.g. following vaccination or an [[infection]] with a [[pathogen]]), these antibodies are further fine-tuned via [[hypermutation]]. [[Memory B cell]]s capable of producing these antibodies form the basis for acquired immunological memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15130504&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crotty S, Ahmed R |title=Immunological memory in humans |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2004 |pmid=15130504 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual therefore carries a unique genetic memory of its immune system's close encounters with pathogens. As a somatic memory, this is not passed on to the next generation.

====In plants====
Plants that undergo [[vernalization]] (promotion of flowering by a prolonged exposure to cold temperatures) record a ''genetic memory of winter'' to gain the competence to flower. The process involves epigenetically recording the length of cold exposure through [[chromatin remodeling]] which leads to mitotically stable changes in gene expression (the &quot;winter code&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16980591&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sung S, Amasino RM |title=Molecular genetic studies of the memory of winter |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=57 |issue=13 |pages=3369–77 |year=2006 |pmid=16980591 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erl105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This releases the inhibition of flowering initiation and allows the plants to bloom with the correct timing at the onset of spring. As a somatic memory, this state is not passed on to subsequent generations but has to be acquired by each individual plant. The process of vernalization was falsely assumed to be a stably inherited genetic memory passed on to subsequent generations by the [[Russia]]n geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]]. Lysenko's claims of genetic memory and efforts to obtain or fabricate results in proof of it had disastrous effects for Russian genetics in the early 20th century (also see: [[Lysenkoism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15466409&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amasino R |title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter |journal=Plant Cell |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=2553–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15466409 |doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inherited epigenetic memory===
In [[genetics]], [[genomic imprinting]] or other patterns of inheritance that are not determined by DNA sequence alone can form an epigenetic memory that is passed on to subsequent generations through [[meiosis]]. In contrast, somatic genetic memories are passed on by [[mitosis]] and limited to the individual, but are not passed on to the offspring. Both processes include similar epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. involving histones and methylation patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17467256&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ooi SL, Henikoff S |title=Germline histone dynamics and epigenetics |journal=Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=257–65 |year=2007 |pmid=17467256 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2007.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17341434&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gehring M, Henikoff S |title=DNA methylation dynamics in plant genomes |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1769 |issue=5-6 |pages=276–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17341434 |doi=10.1016/j.bbaexp.2007.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbial memory===
In microbes, genetic memory is present in the form of inversion of specific DNA sequences serving as a switch between alternative patterns of gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12111734&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Casadesús J, D'Ari R |title=Memory in bacteria and phage |journal=Bioessays |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=512–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12111734 |doi=10.1002/bies.10102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
In [[population genetics]] and [[evolution]], genetic memory represents the recorded history of adaptive changes in a species. Selection of organisms carrying genes coding for the best adapted proteins results in the [[evolution]] of species. An example for such a genetic memory is the [[innate immune response]] that represents a recording of the history of common microbial and viral pathogens encountered throughout the evolutionary history of the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14685686&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dempsey PW, Vaidya SA, Cheng G |title=The art of war: Innate and adaptive immune responses |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=2604–21 |year=2003 |pmid=14685686 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3180-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the somatic memory of the adaptive immune response, the innate immune response is present at birth and does not require the immune system to learn to recognize antigens.

In the history of theories of evolution, the proposed genetic memory of an individual's experiences and environmental influences was a central part of [[Lamarckism]] to explain the inheritance of evolutionary changes.

===Animal behavior===
In [[ethology]], genetic memory refers the inheritance of [[instinct]] in animals and humans.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

'''Evolutionary informatics''' is a subfield of [[informatics]] addressing the practice of information processing in, and the engineering of information systems for, the study of [[biological evolution]], as well as the study of information in evolutionary systems, natural and artificial.

==Information processing in the study of biological evolution==

{{seealso|Computational biology}}

Scientists have gathered an enormous volume of information on biological evolution, and there are problems in management of that information similar to those in [[bioinformatics]] and [[genomics]]. Indeed, bioinformatics and genomics are pertinent to the study of evolution, and utilization of information from those areas is of concern in evolutionary informatics.&lt;ref name=nescent-wiki&gt;&quot;Main page&quot; of the Wiki for the NESCent Evolutionary Informatics Working Group, https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006,&lt;ref name=nescent-wiki/&gt; the [[National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]] (NESCent), sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]],&lt;ref name=nescent-about&gt;National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, &quot;About the Center,&quot; http://www.nescent.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; funded the NESCent Evolutionary Informatics Working Group and conference series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though evolutionary biologists have developed powerful tools for inferring phylogenies, detecting selection, and so on, integrating evolutionary methodology into workflows in bioinformatics does not depend so much on the power of analysis tools as it does on a well developed informatics infrastructure: software and standards for data exchange, visualization, input-and-output, editing, control, and storage-and-retrieval. We propose a working group to facilitate (directly and indirectly) the development of this infrastructure. Through a series of four meetings, each with presentations, discussion, and actual software development, the working group will build on the foundation provided by current analysis tools and available standards.&lt;ref name=nescent-abstract&gt;Stoltzfus, A., and Vos, R. (undated) &quot;Evolutionary informatics: Supporting interoperability in evolutionary analysis&quot; (project summary), https://www.nescent.org/science/awards_summary.php?id=2052&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The working group has filed its first (June 2007)&lt;ref name=nescent-report1&gt;Stoltzfus, A., and Vos, R. (2007) &quot;First report to NESCent,&quot; https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/First_Report_to_NESCent&lt;/ref&gt; and second (December 2007)&lt;ref name=nescent-report2&gt;Stoltzfus, A., and Vos, R. (2007) &quot;Second report to NESCent,&quot; https://www.nescent.org/wg_evoinfo/Second_Report_to_NESCent&lt;/ref&gt; reports to NESCent.

==Study of information processing in evolutionary systems==

The notion that information processing is essential to life and to evolution predates the entry of the term [[informatics]] into the English language (1966).&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)'', http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/informatics.&lt;/ref&gt; Various investigators argued in the 1940's that certain principles of information processing apply both in living and engineered systems, and much of their thinking is encapsulated in [[Norbert Wiener]]'s ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (1948).&lt;ref name=wiener&gt;Wiener, N. (1948) ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine,'' Paris, Hermann et Cie - MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiener regarded evolution as ''phylogenetic learning,'' or accrual of information in the [[genome]]. It should be noted that while [[cybernetics]] and [[biocybernetics]] address information, they place an emphasis on principles of [[feedback]] and [[control system|control]] that [[informatics]] does not.

Relatively recent work has focused on evolution as [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] of [[fitness function]]s, and has addressed the role of information in optimization. Beginning with a 1995 technical report&lt;ref name=WM95&gt;Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1995) No Free Lunch Theorems for Search, Technical Report SFI-TR-95-02-010 (Santa Fe Institute).&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing with a 1997 article, &quot;No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization&quot;&lt;ref name=WM97&gt;Wolpert, D.H., Macready, W.G. (1997), &quot;No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization,&quot; ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'' '''1''', 67. http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/people/dhw/papers/78.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpert and Macready established that [[evolutionary algorithm]]s have average performance no better than that of random search. They argued that superior performance could be achieved only if [[algorithm]]s incorporate prior knowledge of problems, and provided an [[information geometry|information-geometric]] analysis of how algorithms and problems are matched (and mismatched).

English argued in 1996 that there was [[no free lunch]] due to an underlying &quot;conservation of information,&quot;&lt;ref name=English1996&gt;English, T. M. 1996. &quot;Evaluation of Evolutionary and Genetic Optimizers: No Free Lunch,&quot; in L. J. Fogel, P. J. Angeline, T. Bäck (Eds.): ''Evolutionary Programming V: Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on Evolutionary Programming,'' pp. 163-169. http://www.BoundedTheoretics.com/EP96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and pursued the notion further in 1999.&lt;ref name=English99&gt;English, T.M. (1999) &quot;Some information theoretic results on evolutionary optimization,&quot; ''Proceedings of the 1999 Congress on Evolutionary Computation: CEC 99,''pp. 788-795.&lt;/ref&gt; In that work, [[Conservation laws|conservation]] was characterized in terms of [[Shannon information]] and [[mutual information]]. In 2000, English turned to [[Kolmogorov complexity]] as a measure of information in instances of fitness functions and optimization algorithms. He observed that almost all problems exhibit a high degree of [[Kolmogorov randomness]], and thus are easy for almost all optimization algorithms.&lt;ref name=English2000&gt;English, T. M. 2000. &quot;Optimization Is Easy and Learning Is Hard in the Typical Function,&quot; ''Proceedings of the 2000 Congress on Evolutionary Computation: CEC00'', pp. 924-931. http://www.BoundedTheoretics.com/cec2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, English gave a new perspective on conservation by way of characterizing approximate satisfaction of a necessary and sufficient condition for &quot;no free lunch.&quot;&lt;ref name=English2004&gt;English, T. (2004) No More Lunch: Analysis of Sequential Search, ''Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation'', pp. 227-234. http://BoundedTheoretics.com/CEC04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolpert and Macready proved the existence of coevolutionary &quot;free lunches&quot; in 2005.&lt;ref name=WM-coev&gt;Wolpert, D.H., and Macready, W.G. (2005) &quot;Coevolutionary free lunches,&quot; ''IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation'', 9(6): 721-735&lt;/ref&gt; This may be interpreted as the discovery of a problem class for which some [[coevolution|coevolutionary]] algorithms are generally better informed than others of how to solve problems.
 
==Controversy==

In 2007, Professor [[Robert J. Marks II]] included among his [[web pages]] at the [[Baylor University]] [[website]] some pages regarding an &quot;Evolutionary Informatics Laboratory.&quot; The university's administration subsequently removed those pages, which included unpublished scholarly papers coauthored by Marks and [[intelligent design]] advocate [[William A. Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;St. Amant, C. (2007) &quot;New intelligent design conflict hits BU,&quot; The Lariat [publication of Baylor University], Sept. 11, 2007, http://www.baylor.edu/Lariat/news.php?action=story&amp;story=46756&lt;/ref&gt;. The lab's website is now [http://www.EvolutionaryInformatics.org EvolutionaryInformatics.org]. The [[home page]] includes this definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolutionary informatics merges theories of evolution and information, thereby wedding the natural, engineering, and mathematical sciences. Evolutionary informatics studies how evolving systems incorporate, transform, and export information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may be compared to a statement by the [[University of Edinburgh]] School of Informatics: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Informatics studies the representation, processing, and communication of information in natural and engineered systems. [...] The central notion is the transformation of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. [...] Computational systems, whether natural or engineered, are distinguished by their great complexity, as regards both their internal structure and behaviour, and their rich interaction with the environment. Informatics seeks to understand and to construct (or reconstruct) such systems, using analytic, experimental and engineering methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh School of Informatics, &quot;Vision&quot; statement. http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/about/vision.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of January 2008, three unpublished technical papers by Marks and Dembski are available at the Evolutionary Informatics Laboratory's website, and none refers explicitly to evolutionary informatics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutionaryinformatics.org/Publications.html Publications], The Evolutionary Informatics Lab&lt;/ref&gt;
